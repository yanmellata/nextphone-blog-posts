# PART 1: WRITING GUIDELINES

## Voice & Tone

### Target Audience
Small business owners in the US and Canada looking for AI receptionist solutions.

### Voice: Conversational Consultant

You're a knowledgeable advisor helping a small business owner. You're:
- **Confident** but not arrogant
- **Helpful** but not salesy
- **Direct** but not cold
- **Friendly** but not unprofessional

### Key Principles

#### 1. Write Like You Talk
- Use contractions (you're, it's, doesn't)
- Use first/second person (I, you, we)
- Use conversational phrases
- Vary sentence length
- Allow brand tone to come through (friendly, knowledgeable, approachable)

**Good example:**
> "Your phone rings. A potential customer needs help. But you're on a job site, hands covered in drywall mud. The call goes to voicemail. They call the next contractor. You just lost $4,500."

**Bad example (too formal):**
> "It is important to note that in today's digital landscape, AI customer service has emerged as a game-changing solution for businesses looking to leverage cutting-edge technology."

#### 2. Active Voice, Not Passive
✅ "AI answers calls you'd otherwise miss"
❌ "Calls that would otherwise be missed are answered by AI"

#### 3. Short Paragraphs
- Max 2-4 sentences per paragraph
- One idea per paragraph
- Alternate between 1-2 sentence paragraphs and 3-4 sentence ones
- Break up long paragraphs

#### 4. Natural Keyword Usage
- Keywords should flow naturally
- If it feels forced, rewrite
- Don't repeat the same phrase 10 times
- Use semantic variants

#### 5. Show, Don't Just Tell
✅ **Specific scenario:**
> "Your phone rings at 9 PM. A customer needs emergency AC repair—95-degree heat, no cooling. You're at dinner. The call goes to voicemail. They call the next contractor. $3,500 job lost."

❌ **Generic statement:**
> "Businesses lose revenue when they miss calls after hours."

---

## Structure & Readability

### Use Headings and Subheadings
- **H1** for the title (only ONE per post)
- **H2** for major sections
- **H3** for subsections
- Creates logical flow and helps readers scan quickly
- Improves accessibility and SEO

### Short Paragraphs & Lists
- **2-4 sentences per paragraph maximum**
- Avoid walls of text
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for steps, tips, or key takeaways
- Improves readability on screens and mobile devices

### Visual Aids
- Include relevant images, diagrams, or screenshots where appropriate
- Break up text visually
- Target: 4-6 images per post
- Place images every 350-500 words

### Conclusion and CTA
- Brief conclusion summarizing key points
- Clear call-to-action (CTA)
- Example: "Ready to never miss a call? Try NextPhone for free!"
- CTAs should feel like helpful next steps, NOT aggressive sales pitches

---

## People-First Content

### Focus on Pain Points and Solutions
- Address common questions or challenges target audience faces
- Provide substantial, actionable advice
- Reader should think: "That was helpful, I learned something I can use"

**Examples of good topics:**
- "How to handle after-hours calls for your small business"
- "Ways an AI receptionist can improve customer service"

### Original and In-Depth Information
- Offer original insights, examples, or research
- Share knowledge from team expertise (use NextPhone factbase data!)
- Include mini case-studies when possible
- Provide fresh information or unique angle
- Aim for "substantial, comprehensive" take on topic

### Demonstrate E-E-A-T

**Experience:**
- Describe real scenarios or personal experience with the product
- Example: "We analyzed 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months. The data is brutal: 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered."

**Expertise:**
- Explain concepts clearly and accurately
- Use correct terminology in accessible way
- Show depth of knowledge without jargon

**Authoritativeness:**
- Cite reputable sources for stats or claims
- Link out to authoritative websites or studies
- Example: If mentioning "missed calls can cost businesses revenue," back it up with data

**Trustworthiness:**
- Support facts with sources
- Mention credentials when relevant
- Be transparent and honest
- Acknowledge what competitors do well (builds credibility)

### Match Search Intent

**Identify before writing:**
- **Informational intent:** User wants to learn something
- **Commercial intent:** User is comparing solutions
- **Transactional intent:** User is ready to buy

**Ask yourself:**
- Why would someone search for this topic?
- What is the main question they need answered?
- By the end, have you fully addressed it?

### Engage and Educate the Reader
- Use real-world examples and short anecdotes
- Pose rhetorical questions
- Include brief analogies relevant to small business owners' daily life
- Example: "Imagine you're juggling calls and in-store customers—an AI receptionist can answer the phone while you help the person in front of you"

### Encourage Interaction
- Invite readers to comment with their own experiences
- Example: "Have you struggled with handling too many calls? Let us know in the comments."
- End with a question or prompt that makes the reader reflect

---

## Natural Keyword Integration

### Use Keywords Strategically and Naturally

**Include primary keyword:**
- In the title
- In the first paragraph (if it fits naturally)
- In one or more subheadings (H2s)
- Sprinkle keyword and close variants throughout

**Rule of thumb:** If keyword usage feels forced or repetitive, rewrite it.

**❌ DON'T stuff keywords:**
> "AI receptionist is great. AI receptionist helps businesses. AI receptionist answers calls. AI receptionist is affordable. AI receptionist for small business is the best AI receptionist."

**✅ DO use naturally:**
> "An AI receptionist can transform how small businesses handle customer calls. Instead of missing calls while you're working, the AI answers every inquiry—qualifying leads, booking appointments, and routing emergencies to your phone."

### Use Semantic Keywords and Synonyms

Google understands semantic meaning. Don't repeat the exact same phrase.

**Example:** Targeting "AI receptionist for small business"? Also use:
- "virtual receptionist service"
- "AI phone answering"
- "automated receptionist"
- "AI customer service"
- "intelligent call handling"

### Compelling Titles

- Clear and descriptive
- Tell exactly what the article offers
- Entice clicks WITHOUT clickbait or exaggeration
- Include keyword naturally
- 50-60 characters (with keyword front-loaded if possible)

**Good example:** "5 Ways an AI Receptionist Can Save Your Small Business Time and Money"

**Bad example:** "You Won't BELIEVE What This AI Receptionist Can Do! (Number 3 Will SHOCK You!)"

---

## Key Do's & Don'ts

### ✅ DO's - What to Include in Every Post

#### People-Focused Value
Create each post to genuinely help or inform the reader, not just to talk about your product. If your audience would say "this is useful," you're on the right track.

#### Original Insights or Angle
Bring something new to the table:
- Original tips from team experience
- Fresh take on industry news
- Analysis combining info from multiple sources
- Short case study, unique analogy, or customer story
- **Use NextPhone factbase data extensively** (13,175 calls, 25.4% callbacks, 15.9% emergencies)

**At least one unique element per post.**

#### Depth and Comprehensiveness
- Cover the topic so the reader gets a complete answer
- Address all sub-questions a reader might have
- Use subheadings to ensure comprehensiveness

**Example:** Post on "AI receptionist benefits" should cover:
- Cost savings
- 24/7 availability
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Spam filtering
- Callback tracking
- Emergency routing

#### Human Tone and Voice
- Write with personality
- Inject humor or relatable anecdote when appropriate
- Show a human is behind the content
- Avoid dull, generic tone
- Read your post aloud—does it sound like a person talking?

#### Real Examples and Evidence
- Include real examples, data, or quotes whenever possible
- Specifics make content more convincing
- Support facts with sources or clear context
- Quote from industry experts or satisfied customers when available
- **Lead with NextPhone data:** "In our analysis of 13,175 calls..."

#### Call-to-Action (CTA)
Always have a CTA or next step. Examples:
- Try NextPhone
- Sign up for free trial
- Download an ebook
- Read a related article

**Make sure CTA flows from the content.**

Example: After discussing missed calls → "See how our AI receptionist can handle your calls 24/7—check out our free trial."

---

### ❌ DON'Ts - What to Avoid

#### Writing for Bots Instead of People
- Don't create content JUST to rank for a keyword
- Each post should be something you'd write even if search engines didn't exist
- Must be relevant to your audience

#### Spammy or Low-Quality AI Text
- Do NOT publish AI-generated articles untouched
- If using AI to help write:
  - Fact-check thoroughly
  - Edit heavily
  - Add originality
  - Correct any inaccuracies
  - Inject personality
- Raw AI drafts = bland, generic content that Google and readers see as unhelpful

#### Mass-Produced "Fluff"
- **Quality beats quantity**
- Don't churn out 500-word posts that skim the surface
- One in-depth, high-value article > five superficial ones
- Every post should have a purpose and offer something new

#### Duplicate or Plagiarized Content
- Never copy-paste from other websites
- Don't recycle same paragraphs across multiple posts
- If referencing another source, quote and cite (or link and summarize in your own words)
- Each post needs its own angle

#### Keyword Stuffing and SEO Gimmicks
- Keyword stuffing = unnaturally cramming keyword in every sentence
- Google spots this easily (can trigger penalties)
- Write for meaning, not keyword density
- Avoid:
  - Invisible text
  - Irrelevant keywords to bait traffic
  - Misleading titles that don't match content

#### Over-Promotion and Salesiness
- Don't turn every post into a sales pitch
- Content should primarily educate or inform
- Google downranks content that exists only to sell
- Mention how your AI receptionist helps in a helpful, contextual way
- Balance: **Mostly informational + sprinkle of "by the way, this solution can do X"**

---

## Forbidden AI Phrases

These phrases scream "AI-generated." **Never use them:**

❌ "It is important to note that..."
❌ "In today's digital landscape..."
❌ "At the end of the day..."
❌ "Leveraging cutting-edge solutions..."
❌ "In conclusion..." (just conclude naturally)
❌ "Revolutionize your business..."
❌ "Game-changing solution..."
❌ "Unparalleled expertise..."
❌ "Cutting-edge technology..."
❌ "It goes without saying..."
❌ "Needless to say..."
❌ "Seamlessly integrate..."
❌ "Robust solution..."
❌ "Empower your business..."
❌ "Drive meaningful results..."
❌ "Unlock the potential..."
❌ "Transform the way you..."
❌ "Take your business to the next level..."

**If you catch yourself using these, rewrite in plain English.**

**Good writing:**
- Vary sentence structure and vocabulary
- Natural flow, not rigidly formal
- Okay to begin sentence with "And" or use em dash for effect
- Casual tone where suitable
- Specific details or opinions
- Don't write like a Wikipedia article—write like you're talking to a colleague

# PART 2: TECHNICAL SEO

## URL Structure

### Use Short, Clean, Human-Readable URLs

**Good:**
```
/blog/ai-receptionist-benefits
/blog/how-to-reduce-missed-calls
/blog/ai-vs-human-receptionist
```

**Bad:**
```
/blog/2025/11/17/how-an-ai-receptionist-can-help-your-small-business/
/blog/post-12345
/blog/p?id=789
```

### Rules:
- Always include the primary keyword in the slug
- Use lowercase only
- Use hyphens (not underscores)
- Keep it concise (3-6 words max)
- No dates in URL (dates age content)
- No stopwords if possible (the, a, an, for, to)

---

## Indexing & Crawlability

### Make Every Blog Post Indexable

**Default meta tag:**
```html
<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
```

### Checklist:
- [ ] URL appears in XML sitemap within 24h of publishing
- [ ] `robots.txt` does NOT block `/blog/`
- [ ] No duplicate pages
- [ ] Noindex on thin/duplicate pages:
  - Tag pages
  - Category pages with 0 posts
  - Pagination pages (optional)

---

## Site Speed

### Core Web Vitals Requirements

Google heavily ranks based on speed and UX.

**Target metrics:**
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** < 2.5s
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** < 0.1
- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint):** < 200ms

### Optimize by:
- ✅ Compress all images via WebP
- ✅ Preload main fonts
- ✅ Lazy-load all images below the fold
- ✅ Minify JS/CSS
- ✅ Remove unused CSS (Tailwind + PurgeCSS)
- ✅ Avoid heavy 3rd-party scripts
- ✅ Serve pages via a CDN (Vercel/Cloudflare)

---

## Mobile Optimization

### Everything Must Be Fully Responsive

**Requirements:**
- No horizontal scroll
- No text smaller than 14px
- Click targets minimum 44px
- Proper line height (1.5-1.7)
- 16px+ font for body text

**Google uses Mobile-First Indexing** — mobile performance affects ALL ranking.

---

## Internal & External Linking

### Internal Linking Rules

**Every blog post must contain:**
- **3-5 internal links** to relevant pages:
  - Product features
  - Pricing
  - Other blogs
  - Vertical landing pages

**Anchor text must be descriptive:**
- ✅ Use: "AI receptionist for small business"
- ❌ Avoid: "Click here" or "Read more"

**Link OLD posts → NEW posts** whenever new content drops (update existing posts to link to new content)

### External Links

Google trusts pages that cite real sources.

**Add 2-4 authoritative outbound links:**
- Harvard Business Review
- Gartner
- Statista
- Government data (BLS, Census, etc.)
- Academic research

**Always open external links in new tab:**
```html
<a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
```

This boosts E-E-A-T and avoids looking AI-generated.

---

## Schema Markup

### VERY Important for SEO

Add JSON-LD schema for:

#### 1. BlogPosting Schema

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BlogPosting",
  "headline": "Post Title",
  "description": "Post description",
  "datePublished": "2025-01-15",
  "dateModified": "2025-01-20",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "Author Name"
  },
  "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
  "publisher": {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "name": "NextPhone",
    "logo": {
      "@type": "ImageObject",
      "url": "https://getnextphone.com/logo.png"
    }
  },
  "mainEntityOfPage": {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    "@id": "https://getnextphone.com/blog/post-slug"
  }
}
```

#### 2. FAQ Schema

For every FAQ section:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How accurate is AI customer service?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Modern AI customer service platforms achieve 85-95% accuracy..."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. Breadcrumb Schema

Improves CTR and sitelinks:

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 1,
      "name": "Home",
      "item": "https://getnextphone.com"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 2,
      "name": "Blog",
      "item": "https://getnextphone.com/blog"
    },
    {
      "@type": "ListItem",
      "position": 3,
      "name": "Post Title"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. Organization Schema

{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "NextPhone",
  "url": "https://getnextphone.com",
  "logo": "https://getnextphone.com/logo.png",
  "description": "AI receptionist for small businesses"
}
```

**This is one of the highest-ROI technical SEO steps.**

---

## Image SEO

### For Every Image in a Post:

#### 1. Filename Must Contain the Keyword
✅ `ai-receptionist-phone-system.webp`
❌ `IMG_1234.jpg`

#### 2. Add Alt Text
Describe what's in the image (accessibility + SEO):
```html
<img src="ai-receptionist.webp" alt="AI receptionist answering phone call for small business">
```

#### 3. Use WebP Format
- Better compression than JPG/PNG
- Faster load times
- Supported by all modern browsers

#### 4. Compress Under 200 KB
- Use tools like TinyPNG, Squoosh, or ImageOptim
- Target: <100KB for hero images, <50KB for inline images

#### 5. Add Width/Height Attributes
Prevents layout shift (improves CLS):
```html
<img src="image.webp" width="800" height="600" alt="...">
```

**Images should never delay LCP** (lazy-load below-the-fold images)

---

## Meta Tags

### Title Tag Rules

**Requirements:**
- 50-60 characters
- Include primary keyword (front-load if possible)
- Clear, direct, no clickbait

**Good examples:**
- "AI Receptionist for Small Business | Complete 2025 Guide"
- "How to Reduce Missed Calls: 7 Proven Strategies"
- "AI vs Human Receptionist: Cost, ROI & Quality Comparison"

**Bad examples:**
- "The Ultimate Guide to Everything You Need to Know About AI" (too long, vague)
- "You Won't BELIEVE This!!!" (clickbait)

### Meta Description

**Requirements:**
- 140-160 characters
- Include keyword
- Summarize value
- Compelling (encourages click)

**Good example:**
> "Learn how AI customer service works, what it costs, and why small businesses are using it to capture 3X more leads. Real data from 13,175 calls."

**Bad example:**
> "This article is about AI customer service and how it can help businesses with their customer service needs using AI technology."

---

## H1-H3 Structure

### Technical Requirement

**Hierarchy rules:**
- **ONE H1 only** (the headline)
- **H2 for main sections** (6-10 per post)
- **H3 for subsections** (2-5 per H2)
- **No skipping hierarchy** (H1 → H3 is wrong)

**Good structure:**
```
H1: AI Receptionist Guide
  H2: What is an AI Receptionist?
    H3: How It Works
    H3: Key Features
  H2: Benefits of AI Receptionists
    H3: Cost Savings
    H3: 24/7 Coverage
    H3: Improved Customer Experience
  H2: How to Choose an AI Receptionist
```

**Bad structure:**
```
H1: AI Receptionist
  H3: Benefits (skipped H2!)
  H2: Features
    H4: Cost (skipped H3!)
```

Google uses these to understand topical hierarchy.

---

# PART 3: MEGA AI FRAMEWORK

## Page-Level Foundation

### 1.1 Page Metadata

- **Title (H1):** Clear, keyword-aligned, intent-driven

---

## Above-the-Fold Block

What users see without scrolling determines bounce rate.

### 2.1 Hero Image

- High resolution
- Relevant visual (not generic stock)
- WebP format, <100KB
- Descriptive alt text with keyword

### 2.2 Key Takeaways Box

A short bullet list (3-6 bullets) summarizing the post.

**Critical for:**
- User time-on-page
- Google's content scanning
- Featured snippet potential

**Example:**
```markdown
**Key Takeaways:**
- AI customer service uses NLP to understand inquiries 24/7

2. **Why this matters now**
3. **Promise of the article**

Avoid keyword stuffing.

> "Your phone rings at 9 PM. A customer needs emergency AC repair—their system died in 95-degree heat. You're at dinner, and the call goes to voicemail. They call the next contractor. You just lost a $3,500 job. This happens more than you think. In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls, 74.1% went completely unanswered. AI customer service is changing this reality."

### 3.2 Section Layout (H2 + H3-rich)

Every post should follow this rhythm:
1. **Context / Why This Matters**
2. **Definitions / Core Concepts**
3. **Breakdowns / Frameworks / Lists**
4. **Examples** (real or hypothetical)
5. **Actionable Steps or Checklists**
6. **Future Outlook / Predictions** (optional)

### 3.4 Lists, Tables, Frameworks

**Google LOVES structured content.**

---

2. **Mid-article (mid):** "Ready to stop missing calls? See NextPhone in action →"
3. **Bottom (hard CTA):** "Start your free 14-day trial of NextPhone →"
