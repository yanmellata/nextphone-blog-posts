## 4. Key "Do's" – What to Include in Every Post

### ✅ People-Focused Value
Create each post to genuinely help or inform the reader, not just to talk about your product. If your audience would say "this is useful," you're on the right track.

### ✅ Original Insights or Angle
Bring something new to the table:
- Original tips from team experience
- Fresh take on industry news
- Analysis combining info from multiple sources
- Short case study, unique analogy, or customer story

**At least one unique element per post.**

### ✅ Depth and Comprehensiveness
- Cover the topic so the reader gets a complete answer
- Address all sub-questions a reader might have
- Use subheadings to ensure comprehensiveness

**Example:** Post on "AI receptionist benefits" should cover:
- Cost savings
- 24/7 availability
- Improved customer satisfaction
- Spam filtering
- Callback tracking

### ✅ Human Tone and Voice
- Write with personality
- Allow brand tone to come through (friendly, knowledgeable, approachable)
- Inject humor or relatable anecdote when appropriate
- Show a human is behind the content
- Avoid dull, generic tone

### ✅ Real Examples and Evidence
- Include real examples, data, or quotes whenever possible
- Specifics make content more convincing
- Support facts with sources or clear context
- Quote from industry experts or satisfied customers when available

### ✅ Call-to-Action (CTA)
- Always have a CTA or next step
- Examples:
  - Try NextPhone
  - Sign up for free trial
  - Download an ebook
  - Read a related article
- Make sure CTA flows from the content
- Example: After discussing missed calls → "See how our AI receptionist can handle your calls 24/7—check out our free trial."

## 5. Key "Don'ts" – What to Avoid

### ❌ Writing for Bots Instead of People
- Don't create content JUST to rank for a keyword
- Each post should be something you'd write even if search engines didn't exist
- Must be relevant to your audience

### ❌ Spammy or Low-Quality AI Text
- Do NOT publish AI-generated articles untouched
- If using AI to help write:
  - Fact-check thoroughly
  - Edit heavily
  - Add originality
  - Correct any inaccuracies
  - Inject personality
- Raw AI drafts = bland, generic content that Google and readers see as unhelpful

### ❌ Mass-Produced "Fluff"
- **Quality beats quantity**
- Don't churn out 500-word posts that skim the surface
- One in-depth, high-value article > five superficial ones
- Every post should have a purpose and offer something new

### ❌ Duplicate or Plagiarized Content
- Never copy-paste from other websites
- Don't recycle same paragraphs across multiple posts
- If referencing another source, quote and cite (or link and summarize in your own words)
- Each post needs its own angle

### ❌ Keyword Stuffing and SEO Gimmicks
- Keyword stuffing = unnaturally cramming keyword in every sentence
- Google spots this easily (can trigger penalties)
- Write for meaning, not keyword density
- Avoid:
  - Invisible text
  - Irrelevant keywords to bait traffic
  - Misleading titles that don't match content

### ❌ Over-Promotion and Salesiness
- Don't turn every post into a sales pitch
- Content should primarily educate or inform
- Google downranks content that exists only to sell
- Mention how your AI receptionist helps in a helpful, contextual way
- Balance: **Mostly informational + sprinkle of "by the way, this solution can do X"**

### ❌ "AI Tell-Tale" Language
Avoid repetitive, filler phrases AI often overuses:
- "It is important to note that…"
- "In conclusion…" (when adding no value)
- Starting multiple sentences the same way

**Good writing:**
- Vary sentence structure and vocabulary
- Natural flow, not rigidly formal
- Okay to begin sentence with "And" or use em dash for effect
- Casual tone where suitable
- Specific details or opinions
- Don't write like a Wikipedia article—write like you're talking to a colleague

### ❌ Neglecting Proofreading
- Actual errors (spelling mistakes, wrong facts, broken links) harm credibility
- Always proofread
- Typos make content seem hastily generated by AI
- Have a second person review for clarity and accuracy if possible
