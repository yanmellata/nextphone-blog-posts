# PHASE 1: RESEARCH PROMPT

**Goal:** Understand competitive landscape, gather data, identify unique angles

**Time:** ~2 hours
**Input:** Keyword from Wave 2 Focused Blog List
**Output:** Complete research document for Phase 2

**Reference:** See `NEXTPHONE_FACTBASE.md` and `CONTENT_PRODUCTION_GUIDELINES.md`

---

## Overview

Research prevents rewriting. This phase ensures you:
- Understand search intent (what users want)
- Know competitor coverage (table stakes + gaps)
- Have credible data (factbase + external sources)
- Identify unique angle (differentiation)

---

## Step 1.1: Keyword Intelligence (15 mins)

**Actions:**
1. Google primary keyword (incognito)
2. Analyze top 10 results: What format dominates? (guides, comparisons, listicles)
3. Classify intent: **Informational** (learn), **Commercial** (compare), or **Transactional** (buy)
4. Capture ALL "People Also Ask" questions (10-20)
5. Note "Related Searches" at bottom
6. List 5-10 semantic keyword variations

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.1 KEYWORD INTELLIGENCE

**Primary Keyword:** [keyword]
**Search Volume:** [volume/mo]
**Search Intent:** [Informational/Commercial/Transactional]
**Dominant Format:** [Guide/Comparison/Listicle]

**People Also Ask (10-20):**
1. [Question]
2. [Question]
...

**Semantic Keywords (5-10):**
- [Variant 1]
- [Variant 2]
...
```

## Step 1.2: Competitor Analysis (30 mins)

**For top 10 results, capture:**
- Word count
- H2 structure (topics covered)
- Unique angle
- Data/stats used? (sources?)
- Gaps (what they're NOT covering)

**Competitor Matrix:**
| URL | Words | Main Topics | Angle | Data? | Gaps |
|-----|-------|-------------|-------|-------|------|
| competitor1.com | 2,800 | Benefits, Tools | Enterprise | Gartner | No SMB angle |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

**After analyzing all 10, answer:**
- **Common Topics:** What EVERYONE covers (table stakes)
- **Unique Angles:** What only 1-2 cover (evaluate if valuable)
- **Content Gaps:** What NOBODY does well (our opportunity!)

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.2 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

### Competitor Matrix
[Table with all 10]

**Common Topics (Must Cover):**
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

**Content Gaps (Opportunities):**
1. [Gap - what's missing, how we'll fix]
2. [Gap - what's missing, how we'll fix]
3. [Gap - what's missing, how we'll fix]

**Best Practices:**
- Avg word count: [X]
- Common format: [Guide/Listicle]
- Data usage: [Yes/No - what sources?]
```

## Step 1.3: User Intent Research (20 mins)

**Sources to check:**
- **Reddit:** r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur, industry subs
- **Quora:** Most viewed questions on topic
- **Forums:** Contractor/trade forums
- **PAA Deep Dive:** Click questions to reveal more (go 2-3 levels deep)

**Capture:**
- Verbatim quotes (exact user language)
- Pain points / concerns
- Real use cases mentioned

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

**Reddit Insights:**
- "[Verbatim quote]" - r/[subreddit]
- Common themes: [List]

**Quora Top Questions:**
1. [Question]
2. [Question]

**Forum Pain Points:**
- "[Verbatim quote]"
- "[Verbatim quote]"

**Real User Concerns:**
1. [Concern - e.g., "Will AI replace staff?"]
2. [Concern - e.g., "Can it handle complex questions?"]
```

---

## Step 1.4: Authoritative Sources (15 mins)

**Find 5-10 credible sources:**
- **Industry Research:** Gartner, Forrester, McKinsey, Salesforce reports
- **Government/Academic:** BLS, Census, Google Scholar
- **Trade Pubs:** HBR, MIT Tech Review
- **Tech Sources:** OpenAI, AWS case studies

**For each, capture:**
- Title
- URL
- Key stat/insight (exact quote)
- Publication date
- Where you'll use it

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.4 AUTHORITATIVE SOURCES

**Source 1:** [Category - e.g., Industry Research]
- Title: [Full title]
- URL: [Link]
- Key Stat: "[Exact quote]"
- Published: [Month Year]
- Use In: [Section name]

**Source 2:** [Category]
[Same format]

[5-10 total sources]
```

---

## Step 1.5: Internal Data Mining (15 mins)

**Reference:** Open `NEXTPHONE_FACTBASE.md`

**Pull relevant data:**
1. **Core Stats:** 74.1% missed calls, 25.4% callbacks, 15.9% urgency, 6.2% emergencies, $189K lost/year
2. **Customer Quotes:** 3-5 verbatim quotes from factbase
3. **Industry Examples:** Pick 2-3 verticals (roofing, plumbing, legal, etc.) with specific stats
4. **ROI Calculations:** Show math for 2-3 examples

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 74.1% missed calls → Use in: [Section]
- 25.4% callbacks → Use in: [Section]
- 15.9% urgency → Use in: [Section]

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "[Quote]" → Use in: [Section]
2. "[Quote]" → Use in: [Section]

**Industry Examples:**
- **Plumbers:** 66.7% answer rate, $X lost/year
- **Electricians:** 15.5% spam rate, 91% real calls missed

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × $3,500 × 20% close = **$10,956/mo lost**
- AI cost: $199/mo → **ROI: 5,500%**

**How to Cite:**
✅ "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 contractors..."
✅ "According to our 7-month study of 2,487 customer interactions..."
```

## Step 1.6: Gap Analysis & Unique Angle (15 mins)

**Answer these:**
1. **Table stakes:** What must we cover? (all competitors do)
2. **Unique topics:** What 1-2 competitors do differently? (include or skip?)
3. **Content gaps:** What NOBODY covers well? (3-7 opportunities)
4. **Our angle:** How will we differentiate? (1-2 sentences)
5. **Beat #1:** List 3-5 ways we'll beat top-ranking post

**Template:**
```markdown
## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. [Topic]
2. [Topic]
3. [Topic]

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **[Gap]** - Competitors: [What they do], We'll do: [How we'll win]
2. **[Gap]** - Competitors: [What they do], We'll do: [How we'll win]
3. **[Gap]** - Competitors: [What they do], We'll do: [How we'll win]

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> [1-2 sentences describing primary differentiator]
> Example: "Lead with 13,175 call data, focus on SMB home services, show transparent $199/mo pricing with ROI calcs"

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. [Improvement - e.g., "More data-driven (proprietary vs generic stats)"]
2. [Improvement - e.g., "More transparent (show pricing upfront)"]
3. [Improvement - e.g., "Better structured (Key Takeaways, FAQ, cleaner sections)"]
```
