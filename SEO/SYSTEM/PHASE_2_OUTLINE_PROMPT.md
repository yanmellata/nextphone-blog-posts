# PHASE 2: OUTLINE PROMPT

**Goal:** Create detailed blueprint for writing phase with section structure, data placement, and content elements mapped

**Time:** ~1.5 hours
**Input:** Completed research document from Phase 1
**Output:** Detailed section-by-section outline ready for Phase 3 (Writing)

**Reference:** See `NEXTPHONE_FACTBASE.md` and `CONTENT_PRODUCTION_GUIDELINES.md`

---

## Overview

The outline phase transforms research into an actionable writing plan. A great outline:
- Maps the user journey from problem to solution
- Specifies exactly what goes in each section
- Plans where data, images, links, and CTAs go
- Ensures all table stakes topics + differentiators are covered

**Why outline?** Writing without an outline leads to rambling content, forgetting key topics, poor flow, missing data/CTAs, and hours of rewriting. With an outline, writing becomes fill-in-the-blanks.

---

## Step 2.1: Intent-Driven Structure Planning (15 mins)

**Goal:** Match outline structure to user journey and search intent

**Questions to Answer:**

1. **What is the user's intent?** (from Phase 1 research)
   - **Awareness:** Learning what [topic] is (early journey)
   - **Consideration:** Comparing options (mid journey)
   - **Decision:** Ready to implement/buy (late journey)

2. **What's the user journey for this post?**
   Example: Problem awareness → Understanding solution → How it works → Evaluating options → Implementation → Considering NextPhone

3. **What questions must we answer in what order?**
   List 8-12 questions in sequence (e.g., What is it? Why does it matter? How does it work? What are benefits? What are options? How much? Real examples? How to implement? What about NextPhone? FAQ)

**Template:**
```markdown
## 2.1 STRUCTURE PLANNING

**User Intent:** [Awareness/Consideration/Decision]

**User Journey:**
1. [Step 1 - e.g., "Problem awareness"]
2. [Step 2 - e.g., "Understanding solution"]
3. [Step 3 - e.g., "Evaluating options"]
4. [Step 4 - e.g., "Considering NextPhone"]

**Questions to Answer (in order):**
1. [Question 1]
2. [Question 2]
...
10. [Question 10]

**High-Level Section Flow:**
- Intro → Hook with problem/data
- Section 1-2 → Context & Problem
- Section 3-5 → Solution & How It Works
- Section 6-7 → Benefits & Examples
- Section 8 → NextPhone Product Mention
- FAQ → Address remaining questions
- Conclusion → Recap & CTA
```

---

## Step 2.2: Competitor Topic Mapping (10 mins)

**Goal:** Ensure we cover table stakes + differentiate

From Phase 1 research, pull:
- Table stakes topics (what ALL competitors cover)
- Gap topics (what we'll cover that they don't)

For each topic, decide which section will cover it.

**Template:**
```markdown
## 2.2 TOPIC COVERAGE CHECKLIST

### Table Stakes Topics (MUST Cover)
- [ ] [Topic 1] → Will cover in: **Section X**
- [ ] [Topic 2] → Will cover in: **Section X**
- [ ] [Topic 3] → Will cover in: **Section X**
- [ ] [Topic 4] → Will cover in: **Section X**
- [ ] [Topic 5] → Will cover in: **Section X**

### Differentiating Topics (SHOULD Cover to Beat Competitors)
- [ ] [Gap topic 1 - e.g., "Transparent pricing"] → **Section X**
- [ ] [Gap topic 2 - e.g., "Real call data"] → **Section X**
- [ ] [Gap topic 3 - e.g., "SMB focus"] → **Throughout**
- [ ] [Gap topic 4 - e.g., "ROI calculations"] → **Section X**

### Topics to Skip (And Why)
- [Topic X] - Reason: [e.g., "Too technical for target audience"]
- [Topic Y] - Reason: [e.g., "Not relevant to SMBs"]
```

## Step 2.3: Detailed Section-by-Section Outline (30 mins)

**Goal:** Create blueprint for writing phase with complete detail

**For EACH Section, Define:**
1. **H2 Title** (include keyword variants naturally)
2. **Purpose** (what question does this answer?)
3. **Word Count Target** (sum should equal total target)
4. **H3 Subsections** (3-5 per H2)
5. **Key Points** (bullets of what to cover)
6. **Data/Stats to Include** (from research doc + NEXTPHONE_FACTBASE.md)
7. **Examples to Use** (customer quotes, case studies, scenarios)
8. **Visuals Needed** (chart, screenshot, diagram - placeholder description)
9. **Links to Add** (internal + external with anchor text)

**Section Template:**
```markdown
## SECTION [#]: [H2 Title]

**Purpose:** [What question does this answer?]
**Word Count Target:** [X-Y words]

**H3 Subsections:**
1. [Subsection 1 title]
2. [Subsection 2 title]
3. [Subsection 3 title]

**Key Points to Cover:**
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** [e.g., "74.1% missed calls"] - Source: NextPhone factbase

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: [e.g., "HVAC contractor scenario - on roof, can't answer"]
- Quote: "[Verbatim customer quote from factbase]"

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: [e.g., "Bar chart showing % missed calls by industry"]
- Placement: After [which paragraph/subsection]
- Alt text: "[Description]"

**Links to Add:**
- **Internal:** Link to [page] with anchor text "[text]" - Context: [why linking]
- **External:** Cite [source] with anchor text "[text]" - Context: [why citing]
```

**Typical blog structure (8-12 sections):**
1. Key Takeaways Box (3-6 bullets)
2. Intro (100-150 words)
3. Section 1: Context/Background (300-400 words)
4. Section 2: Problem Deep-Dive (400-500 words)
5. Section 3: How It Works (500-600 words)
6. Section 4: Benefits (600-700 words)

## Tips for Great Outlines

**Do:**
✅ Be specific (not "cover benefits" but "benefit 1: 24/7, benefit 2: cost savings")
✅ Assign word counts to each section (ensures proper depth)
✅ Map data placement BEFORE writing (prevents forgetting key stats)
✅ Plan visuals early (easier to write around image placement)
✅ Get outline approved before writing (saves hours of rewriting)

**Don't:**
❌ Be vague ("cover AI topic" → what specifically?)
❌ Skip word count targets (leads to unbalanced sections)
❌ Forget about CTAs/links in outline (harder to add later)
❌ Rush to writing phase (outline saves time, not wastes it)
❌ Ignore the user journey (content should flow logically)
