## Title
After-Hours Emergency Triage: Emergency vs Non-Emergency Routing Logic

## Primary Keyword
after-hours emergency triage

## Angle (Unique Positioning)
After-hours call routing logic: true emergency (no heat in winter, burst pipe, legal arrest, medical urgent care) → instant transfer to on-call staff, moderate urgency (AC not working in summer but not heatwave, legal consultation needed soon) → collect info + schedule early next-morning callback, low urgency (routine appointment request, general inquiry) → schedule next business day callback. Escalation triggers, on-call rotation (who's on call tonight?), emergency contact tree (try technician → try manager → try owner), emergency vs non-emergency examples by industry (HVAC: no heat in winter with kids/elderly = emergency, routine maintenance = non-urgent), caller expectation management ("This is not an emergency, we'll call you back tomorrow at 9am").
