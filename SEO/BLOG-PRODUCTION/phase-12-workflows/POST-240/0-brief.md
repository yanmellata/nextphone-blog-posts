## Title
SMS Follow-Up Automation Playbook: Post-Call Sequences Timing & Templates

## Primary Keyword
SMS follow-up automation

## Angle (Unique Positioning)
Post-call SMS automation: immediate confirmation ("Thanks for calling, your appointment is confirmed for [DATE]"), 1-hour follow-up (missed call → "We missed your call, here's my calendar link to book: [URL]"), next-day engagement ("Hi [NAME], following up on your service request. Any questions?"), review request sequence (3 days after service: "How did we do? Leave a review: [LINK]"), re-engagement for non-responders (7 days: "Still interested in [SERVICE]? Reply YES to schedule"). Timing strategy, message templates by industry, TCPA compliance (opt-in requirements, opt-out handling), A/B testing SMS copy, click-through rate optimization.
