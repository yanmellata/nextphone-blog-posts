## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

**Key User Concerns from Research:**

**"How do I qualify leads without wasting time on unqualified callers?"**
- Small businesses want to screen out tire-kickers before spending time on calls
- Need to identify serious buyers vs information gatherers
- Want consistent qualification (not dependent on who answers phone)

**"Can AI really ask the right questions for MY business?"**
- Concern: Generic scripts don't work for specialized industries
- Need: Customizable questions specific to their service/product
- Example: Roofing contractor needs to know "repair vs replacement" while lawyer needs "case type and urgency"

**"How does the qualification data get into my CRM?"**
- Frustration with manual data entry after calls
- Want automatic push to HubSpot/Salesforce/Pipedrive
- Need custom field mapping to their specific CRM setup

**"What's the difference between hot, warm, and cold leads?"**
- Want clear criteria for lead priority
- Need automatic routing of hot leads to phone/SMS
- Desire scoring logic they can customize for their business

**Real User Quotes (Paraphrased from Forums/Reviews):**
- "I don't want to talk to every person who calls. I need the AI to figure out if they're serious first."
- "BANT doesn't work for my industry. I need different questions."
- "The AI collects info but then I have to manually type it into Salesforce. What's the point?"
- "How do I train the AI to know what makes a lead 'hot' for my business specifically?"

**Forum Pain Points:**
- "Generic qualification scripts feel robotic and turn off real customers"
- "I need to collect budget info without sounding pushy or sales-y"
- "Different services need different qualification paths (emergency vs routine)"
- "Lost leads because AI couldn't identify urgency and didn't route call properly"

## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats to Use:**

**Arbitrary Data Collection (KEY DIFFERENTIATOR):**
- The AI receptionist can **collect any information from callers in real time**
- Fully customizable (preset or dynamically defined)
- Examples: name, phone, email, new vs existing customer, willingness to pay/budget, call intent, job title, company name, call frequency, preferred contact method, ANY business-specific field

- **Use in:** Urgency detection and hot lead identification sections

**Revenue Impact:**
- For 42 calls/month business: **74.1% missed = 31 missed calls**

1. What is lead qualification and why it matters
2. BANT framework explanation
3. Custom qualification questions examples
4. AI automation benefits
5. CRM integration basics
6. Hot vs warm vs cold lead definitions

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

1. **Phone-based arbitrary data collection**
   - Competitors: Focus on web forms, chat, email qualification
   - We'll do: Emphasize NextPhone collects ANY custom data during PHONE CALLS in real-time
   - Advantage: Most businesses still get calls, not just web forms

2. **Industry-specific qualification paths**
   - Competitors: Generic BANT examples, mostly B2B SaaS
   - We'll do: Show roofing, plumbing, electrical, legal, real estate custom questions with our data
   - Advantage: SMB home services focus with 13,175 call data

3. **Urgency detection as qualification**
   - Competitors: Don't address urgency/emergency identification
   - We'll do: Use 15.9% urgency stat to show how AI detects hot leads automatically
   - Advantage: Emergency = higher revenue ($4,200 vs $3,500)

4. **Real-time CRM field mapping during calls**
   - Competitors: Explain field mapping conceptually
   - We'll do: Show actual HTTP webhook template, explain how data flows DURING call
   - Advantage: Technical depth + no manual data entry

5. **Beyond yes/no questions**
   - Competitors: Smith.ai limited to 3 yes/no questions
   - We'll do: Explain NextPhone can ask open-ended questions, collect freeform text, extract budget ranges
   - Advantage: More sophisticated qualification

6. **Callback request tracking as qualification**
   - Competitors: Don't mention callback tracking
   - We'll do: Use 25.4% callback stat to show qualified leads often request callbacks
   - Advantage: Unique insight from our data

7. **ROI of proper qualification**
   - Competitors: Generic "saves time" claims
   - We'll do: Show math: 42 calls × 20% qualify × $3,500 = X revenue captured
   - Advantage: Specific revenue calculations

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Lead with NextPhone's arbitrary data collection capability during phone calls. Most competitors focus on web form/chat qualification. We emphasize: (1) Phone calls are still primary for SMBs, (2) AI can collect ANY custom field you define, not just BANT, (3) Industry-specific examples from our 13,175 call dataset, (4) Real-time CRM push with custom field mapping, (5) Urgency detection identifies hot leads automatically. Position as "train your AI receptionist to ask YOUR specific qualification questions" vs generic frameworks.

**How We'll Beat #1 (Monday.com BANT article):**
1. **More SMB-focused** - Monday targets enterprise, we target contractors/trades/solopreneurs
2. **Phone-specific** - They focus on CRM workflows, we focus on phone call qualification
3. **Proprietary data** - We have 13,175 calls analyzed vs their generic stats
4. **Industry examples** - We show roofing, plumbing, HVAC examples vs their generic B2B
5. **Technical depth** - We explain HTTP webhooks, field mapping, custom parameters vs conceptual overview
