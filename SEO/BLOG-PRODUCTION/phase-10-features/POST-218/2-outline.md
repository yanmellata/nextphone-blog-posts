- Can't answer specific questions about YOUR services, pricing, policies
- Defaults to "I'll transfer you" or "Let me take a message" for anything outside script

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example 1: Electrical contractorcustomer asks about commercial vs residential rates, generic AI doesn't know the difference
- Example 2: Roofing companycaller asks about specific shingle brands, AI can't answer
- Quote: "I tried an AI receptionist but it couldn't answer specific questions about our services. Just kept saying 'I'll have someone call you back.' Defeats the purpose." - r/smallbusiness
