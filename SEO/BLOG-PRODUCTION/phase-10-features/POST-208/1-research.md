- 74.1% missed calls ’ Use in: Introduction hook (the problem)
- 25.4% callbacks requested ’ Use in: Failover section (importance of backup routing)
- 15.9% urgency calls ’ Use in: Conditional forwarding section (priority routing)
- 6.2% true emergencies ’ Use in: Time-based routing (after-hours emergency handling)

**Customer Quotes:**

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 avg job = **$21,700/month lost**

2. Types: Conditional vs Unconditional
3. Sequential vs Simultaneous routing
4. Time-based routing setup
5. Failover configuration
6. Voicemail integration
7. Setup instructions (carrier codes)

3. **AI + Forwarding Hybrid** - Competitors: Only discuss traditional forwarding | We'll do: Show how AI screening + conditional forwarding = intelligent routing
4. **Emergency Priority Routing** - Competitors: Generic time-based routing | We'll do: Show how to route 15.9% of urgent calls differently using keywords/criteria
5. **Mobile-First Setup** - Competitors: Focus on desk phones/PBX | We'll do: Mobile worker scenarios (contractor on roof, plumber under house)
6. **Comparison Table** - Competitors: Text explanations only | We'll do: Clear table comparing sequential vs simultaneous vs conditional with use cases
7. **Revenue Impact** - Competitors: Generic "reduce missed calls" | We'll do: Specific math ($21,700/mo lost for typical contractor)

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Lead with brutal reality: 74.1% of business calls go unanswered.
