**Purpose:** Explain the fundamental limitation of traditional systems
**Word Count Target:** 300-350 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Why Humans Can Only Handle One Call
2. Traditional Phone System Capacity Limits
3. The Queue Fallacy

**Key Points to Cover:**

- Traditional phone lines: Physical limitation (1 call per line)
- Call queues don't solve the problem (people hang up)
- Even with 4 lines and 4 receptionists, simultaneous calls still limited
- Visual comparison: 1 receptionist vs 100 callers trying to reach you

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **External:** "Auto attendants can handle unlimited simultaneous calls, while live receptionists can only manage one call at a time" - RingCentral
- **Internal:** 74.1% of calls go unanswered (capacity is part of the problem)

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: 4-person office, all on calls, 5th caller gets busy signal or endless hold music
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data" - Plumber

**Visual Needed:**

## SECTION 4: The Real Cost of Busy Signals

**Purpose:** Quantify revenue loss from insufficient capacity
**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. What Happens When Customers Get Busy Signals
2. The Math on Lost Storm Revenue
3. Annual Impact Across Multiple Events

**Key Points to Cover:**
- 73% of customers who get busy signal don't call back
- They immediately call next contractor on Google
- You don't even know you lost the job
- Calculate storm scenario: 10 simultaneous, only 4 lines, 6 busy signals
- 6 busy × 73% = 4.4 lost jobs
- At $8,500/roofing job = $37,400 lost in single afternoon
- Multiple storms per year compounds the loss

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **External:** "73% of customers who encounter a busy signal will not call back, moving directly to a competitor" - 8x8
- **Calculation:** 10 calls - 4 lines = 6 busy signals × 73% no callback × $8,500 job = $37,400 per storm
- **Annual:** 3-4 storms/year = $112,200-$149,600/year lost

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Customer perspective: "I called, got a busy signal, called the next roofer, they answered, I booked them"
- Contractor: "I had no idea how many calls I was missing during storms"

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Bar chart or calculation visualization

## SECTION 7: Cost Comparison: Adding Capacity

**Purpose:** Show economics of traditional per-line vs unlimited
**Word Count Target:** 200-250 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Traditional Per-Line Pricing
2. The Over-Provisioning Problem
