## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

**Reddit Insights:**
- "I'm a one-man plumbing business. Sometimes I'm under a house and miss emergency calls. They just call the next plumber. How do I fix this without hiring someone?" - r/smallbusiness
- "We have two locations. Customers calling our main number should go to whoever is closest. Is this possible without expensive enterprise software?" - r/entrepreneur
- "I need calls that say 'emergency' to ring my cell phone immediately. Everything else can wait. Can AI do this?" - r/Contractor
- Common themes: Affordability, simplicity, emergency handling, location-based routing without enterprise complexity

**Quora Top Questions:**
1. How does AI detect if a call is urgent?
2. What's the difference between IVR and intelligent routing?
3. Can small businesses afford intelligent call routing?
4. How do you route calls to mobile phones vs office?
5. What happens if the primary person doesn't answer?
6. Can routing rules change based on time of day?
7. How does CRM-based routing work?

**Forum Pain Points (ContractorTalk, PlumbingZone):**
- "I lost a $6,000 emergency pipe burst job because I was on another job site and couldn't answer. The customer called three other plumbers before someone picked up."
- "We have three crews. Customers calling for service in the north side should go to our north crew, not our south crew 45 minutes away. Right now it's random."
- "After hours, I only want emergency calls forwarded to me. Everything else can go to voicemail and I'll call back in the morning."

**Real User Concerns:**
1. Will it work for a solo business or small team? (not just enterprises)
2. Can it handle emergency detection without keywords? (what if caller doesn't say "emergency"?)
3. How much does it cost? (affordable for SMB?)
4. Is setup complicated? (can I do it myself?)
5. What if the AI routes wrong? (fallback/transfer options?)
6. Can it integrate with my existing CRM/tools?

2. (From factbase philosophy) "The AI replaces a human receptionist without forcing process change" ’ Use in: Benefits section

**Industry Examples:**
- **General Contractors (19 customers):** On ladder, hands dirty, can't answer ’ Emergency calls for pipe burst, roof leak
- **Electricians (5 customers):** In attics/crawl spaces, power out emergencies = high value time-sensitive
- **Plumbers (3 customers):** Under houses, 2 AM burst pipe calls
- **HVAC (2 customers):** On ladders, summer AC out in 95° heat = critical

**Product Capabilities:**
- **Live call transfer:** AI transfers to human mid-conversation with configurable message
- **Custom HTTP webhooks:** CRM integration, push leads to HubSpot/Salesforce/any system during calls
- **AI emergency detection:** Triggers transfer based on keywords or custom criteria

- **Time-based routing:** Available via configurable rules
- **Multi-number support:** Route different business numbers to different destinations

**ROI Calculations:**
- Typical contractor: 42 calls/mo, 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
- If 15.9% are urgent (7 calls/mo) at $4,200 average
- Missing 1 emergency/week = 4/mo × $4,200 = **$16,800/mo lost**
- NextPhone cost: $199/mo ’ **ROI: 8,400%** if it captures just 1 emergency/month

## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What is intelligent call routing (definition)
2. Types of routing (skill-based, time-based, location-based, priority-based)
3. How it works (basic flow/logic)
4. Benefits (efficiency, customer satisfaction, cost savings)
5. Integration capabilities (CRM, calendar, phone systems)
6. Implementation considerations

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **Emergency Detection with Real Data** - Competitors: Generic "priority routing", We'll do: Show 15.9% urgency rate, 6.2% true emergencies, AI keyword detection, $16,800/mo cost of missing emergencies
2. **SMB-Focused Examples** - Competitors: Enterprise multi-location contact centers, We'll do: Solo plumber under house, roofer on ladder, 2-person HVAC crew
3. **Transparent Pricing & ROI** - Competitors: "Contact sales" or vague pricing, We'll do: $199/mo vs $500-800 traditional, show ROI math with emergency call value
4. **CRM-Based Routing Mechanics** - Competitors: "Integrates with CRM" (vague), We'll do: HTTP webhook details, template variables, real workflow example
5. **Failover Logic for Small Teams** - Competitors: Enterprise failover (complex queues), We'll do: "Ring owner's cell if AI can't handle" simple logic
6. **Multi-Location Without Enterprise Complexity** - Competitors: Multi-site contact center setups, We'll do: Contractor with 2 crews/areas, simple routing rules
7. **Real Revenue Impact** - Competitors: Generic efficiency gains, We'll do: 13,175 call analysis, missed emergency = $4,200 lost, specific calculations

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Lead with emergency detection data (15.9% urgency, 6.2% true emergencies, $16,800/mo cost). Focus on SMB home services contractors who can't answer while working. Show how intelligent routing isn't just for call centersit's for the solo plumber who needs emergencies on his cell and quotes in his CRM. Use 13,175 call analysis for credibility. Transparent pricing ($199/mo) with ROI math. Conversational consultant tone, not enterprise IT whitepaper.

**How We'll Beat #1 (RingCentral):**
1. **More data-driven** - Proprietary 13,175 call analysis vs generic industry stats
2. **More SMB-focused** - Contractor scenarios vs enterprise call center examples
3. **More transparent** - Show $199/mo pricing upfront vs "contact sales"
4. **Better emergency coverage** - Deep dive on emergency detection (15.9% urgency data) vs basic "priority routing"
5. **More actionable** - Real webhook examples, template variables vs vague "integrations available"
6. **Better structure** - Key Takeaways box, FAQ, cleaner sections vs long enterprise explainer
