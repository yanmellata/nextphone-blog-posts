## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats to Use:**
- **74.1% of calls go unanswered** ’ Use in: Problem section (why routing matters for franchises)
- **25.4% of calls request callbacks** ’ Use in: Overflow routing importance
- **15.9% of calls contain urgency language** ’ Use in: Emergency routing setup
- **6.2% are true emergencies** ’ Use in: After-hours routing, territory overflow
- **$199/mo NextPhone vs $500-800/mo traditional** ’ Use in: Pricing comparison

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls
   ’ Use in: Problem awareness for multi-location franchises

2. (Implied from factbase) "Without proper routing, franchises lose calls to competitors when local franchisee can't answer"
   ’ Use in: Territory overflow benefits

**Industry Examples from Factbase:**
- **Home Services Contractors (47 customers):** Average 42 calls/month per location
- **Multi-location scenarios:** Location A closed ’ call should overflow to Location B in same region
- **Emergency routing:** 6.2% emergencies need immediate routing to on-call tech regardless of territory
- **Territory conflicts:** Caller on boundary needs clear routing rule (nearest location, ZIP match, area code)

**Product Capabilities (HTTP Webhooks + Routing from Factbase):**

**What NextPhone Can Do for Multi-Location:**
- Geographic routing by ZIP code or area code
- Location-specific greetings while maintaining brand consistency
- Centralized dashboard for corporate oversight
- Franchisee-level customization (hours, routing rules, greetings)
- Overflow routing (location closed ’ route to next nearest)
- Emergency keyword detection ’ route to on-call regardless of territory
- Call recording and analytics per location
- Unified reporting across all franchise locations

**Territory-Based Routing Example:**
```
ZIP codes 80201-80299 (Denver) ’ Route to Denver Franchise
ZIP codes 85001-85099 (Phoenix) ’ Route to Phoenix Franchise
After-hours Denver ’ Overflow to Phoenix (same timezone)
Emergency keywords detected ’ Route to corporate on-call
```

**Location-Specific Greeting Example:**
- **Corporate brand intro:** "Thank you for calling [Franchise Brand Name]"
- **Location customization:** "You've reached our Denver location serving the Metro area"
- **Consistency enforcement:** Corporate can set required phrases, franchisees customize location details

**ROI Calculations (from factbase data):**
1. **Per-Location Missed Call Impact:**
   - 42 calls/month × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls per location
   - 5 franchise locations = 155 total missed calls/month
   - At 20% conversion × $3,500 avg job = $108,500/month lost revenue opportunity

2. **Multi-Location Routing Value:**
   - Overflow routing recovers 30% of missed calls when one location busy
   - 155 missed × 30% recovery = 47 additional answered calls/month
   - 47 × 20% conversion × $3,500 = $32,900/month recovered revenue

3. **Cost Comparison (5 Franchise Locations):**
   - Traditional PBX: $5,000 setup/location + $200/month × 5 = $25,000 + $1,000/month
   - Cloud VoIP: $0 setup + $30/user × 3 users × 5 locations = $450/month
   - NextPhone: $0 setup + $199/month unlimited (all locations) = $199/month
   - **Savings: $251-801/month vs alternatives**

**How to Cite NextPhone Data:**
’ "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% went completely unanswered."
’ "Multi-location franchises face amplified missed call costswith 5 locations averaging 42 calls/month each, that's 155 missed opportunities monthly without proper routing."
’ "Our study found 6.2% of calls are emergencies requiring immediate response regardless of territory boundaries."
