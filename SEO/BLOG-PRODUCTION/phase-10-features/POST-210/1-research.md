## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What email notifications after calls are
2. Types of information included in emails
3. Benefits of automated email notifications
4. Missed call alerts vs answered call summaries
5. Integration with business tools
6. How to set up email notifications

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **Real callback data** - Competitors: "Follow-ups are important", We'll do: "25.4% of calls request callbacks, without tracking 80% never happen = $113K/year lost"
2. **SMB contractor angle** - Competitors: Generic business focus, We'll do: Specific scenarios (plumber under sink, electrician in attic, roofer on ladder)
3. **AI-generated summaries** - Competitors: Mention transcripts vaguely, We'll do: Show what AI extracts (caller intent, action items, urgency level)
4. **Team notification workflows** - Competitors: Basic "send to team", We'll do: Emergency routing, lead distribution, manager oversight examples
5. **Transparent pricing** - Competitors: No pricing mentioned, We'll do: $199/mo vs $35K/year receptionist to manually track calls
6. **Implementation clarity** - Competitors: Vague setup info, We'll do: Show it's automatic with NextPhone (Resend API, no setup needed)

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Lead with 25.4% callback request stat showing massive lost revenue from forgotten follow-ups. Focus on SMB home services contractors who miss calls on job sites. Differentiate with AI-generated summaries (not just voicemail transcripts) and transparent $199/mo all-inclusive pricing. Show email notifications as part of complete workflow automation (not just alerts).

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More data-driven** - Use proprietary 13,175 call dataset vs generic claims
2. **More specific** - Contractor scenarios (on roof, under sink) vs generic "business" examples
3. **More complete** - Cover full workflow (email ’ action ’ CRM) vs just "you get an email"
4. **Better structured** - Key Takeaways, FAQ, clear sections vs dense feature pages
5. **More transparent** - Show pricing and ROI vs hiding costs
