**Customer Quotes:**

   ’ Use in: Problem awareness section

**Industry Examples:**

- **Roofing:** On roof installing shingles, storm season call spikes
- **HVAC:** On ladders, summer/winter emergencies (AC out in 95° heat)
- **General Contractors:** On job sites, on ladders, hands covered in materials

**ROI Calculations:**

**Scenario 1: Typical Contractor (42 calls/month)**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls/month
- 31 missed × 20% conversion rate × $3,500 average job = $21,700/month lost
- Annual loss: $260,400/year
- NextPhone cost: $199/mo = $2,388/year
- **ROI: 10,812% ($260,400 saved / $2,388 cost)**

**Scenario 2: Emergency Calls**
- 15.9% urgent calls = ~7 urgent calls/month for 42-call/month business
- Emergency jobs average $4,200 (higher than routine)
- Miss 1 emergency/week = 4/month × $4,200 = $16,800/month lost
- Annual loss: $201,600/year
- **Missing just ONE emergency call per week costs more than most contractors make in a year**

**Scenario 3: Speed Advantage**
- Traditional answering service: 10-30 seconds (3-5 rings)
- NextPhone: <5 seconds (1 ring or less)
- Customer expects answer in <10 seconds (60% of customers)
- **Being 5-25 seconds faster = getting the customer vs losing them**

 "We found that 15.9% of calls contained urgency language like 'emergency,' 'urgent,' or 'ASAP'and these calls average $4,200 in revenue."
 "According to our study of 13,175 calls, instant answer (under 5 seconds) is the difference between capturing a customer and losing them to a competitor."
