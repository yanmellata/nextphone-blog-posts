**Word Count Target:** 350-400 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Traditional Scheduling Costs
2. AI Appointment Scheduling Costs
3. ROI Calculation for Small Businesses

**Key Points to Cover:**

**Traditional Costs:**
- Full-time receptionist: $35,000/year ($2,900/month) + benefits
- Part-time answering service: $500-800/month for 100 calls (overage fees)
- Manual scheduling time: 3-10 hours/week owner time = $780-2,600/month opportunity cost
- Cost of missed appointments: $50,400/year (calculated earlier)
- Cost of no-shows: 23% rate = significant revenue loss

**AI Costs:**
- Entry-level platforms: $99-199/month
- Mid-tier (NextPhone): $199/month unlimited calls
- Enterprise: $500-1,000+/month
- Setup time: hours (not weeks)
- No ongoing management needed

**ROI Calculation:**
- Typical contractor scenario:
  - 42 calls/month, 3.2 scheduling calls, 2.4 lost (74.1% miss rate)
  - Lost appointments: 2.4/month × $3,500 avg = $8,400/month = $100,800/year
  - Conservative 30% recovery with AI = $30,240/year gained
  - AI cost: $199/month = $2,388/year
  - Net gain: $27,852/year
  - **ROI: 1,067%**
- No-show reduction adds another $18-36K/year (from Section 7)
- Total impact: $45-63K/year for $2,388 investment

- **Stat 3:** "For typical contractor receiving 42 calls/month, if 74.1% go unanswered (31 missed calls), and just 20% would convert at $3,500 project value, that's $21,700/month in lost revenueor $260,400/year" - Source: NextPhone factbase

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Plumbing business paying $600/month for answering service that only handles 100 calls (they get 150/month). Overage fees bring it to $850/month. Switch to AI at $199/month saves $651/month = $7,812/year, PLUS captures more appointments
