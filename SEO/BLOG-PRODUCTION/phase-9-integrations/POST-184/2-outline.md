## KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-the-fold summary for scanners
**Word Count Target:** 60-80 words (3-5 bullets)

**Bullets:**
- Asana integration connects phone calls to project management, automatically creating tasks from customer conversations
- 25.4% of calls request callbacks and 6.9% are estimate requestswithout automation, these become lost project opportunities worth $17,000/month
- Integration methods range from Zapier (easiest) to API (most flexible) to AI-powered solutions (no-code intelligence)
- NextPhone's AI receptionist analyzes calls in real-time, creates Asana tasks with full context, and assigns them to the right team members
- Project-based businesses save 2.5 hours/month on manual task entry while capturing every lead

---

## INTRO SECTION

**Purpose:** Hook reader with relatable scenario + promise value
**Word Count Target:** 120-150 words

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Open with specific scenario: Contractor on job site, phone rings, estimate request call, goes to voicemail, customer calls next contractor
- The call contained project details worth $5,200, but it never made it to Asana project board
- This happens more often than you think
- Transition: What if every call automatically became an Asana task?

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- Specific dollar amount ($5,200 estimate example)
- Tease the 6.9% stat (will detail later)

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Scenario: Roofing contractor misses estimate call while on ladder

**Visual Needed:** None (save hero for after intro)
