You're under a sink, water spraying everywhere, phone ringing in your pocket. By the time you dry your hands and pull it out, it's gone to voicemail. The customer calls the next plumber. You just lost a $3,500 job.

This happens every single day to field service contractors. You're excellent at your trade, but you can't answer the phone while you're working. [ServiceM8](https://www.servicem8.com/) helps you manage jobs brilliantlybut it can't answer the calls that create those jobs in the first place.

Here's how NextPhone fills that gap.

## What Is ServiceM8?

### Job Management Built for Field Service

ServiceM8 is job management software built specifically for trade contractors and home service businesses. If you're a plumber, electrician, HVAC technician, cleaner, or locksmith, ServiceM8 is designed for you.

The platform handles everything after you win a job: digital job cards, scheduling, quotes, invoicing, and payments. Your technicians get a mobile app (iOS primarily) that shows their schedule, job details, customer info, and allows them to complete checklists, capture photos, and get customer signaturesall paperless.

### Who Uses ServiceM8

ServiceM8 originated in Australia and has grown 248% over the past three years. The target market is clear: small to mid-size field service operations, typically ranging from solo operators up to teams of 20 staff.

Pricing reflects this positioning. ServiceM8 starts at $29 per month for a single user and scales to about $119 per month for 10 users. The job-volume-based pricing model means you pay for what you use, not rigid per-seat tiers.

### Core Features

ServiceM8 shines at workflow management. You can create job templates for common service types, automate scheduling based on technician availability and location, send quotes directly from the field, and sync everything with accounting platforms like Xero and QuickBooks.

The platform also [integrates with 8,000+ apps](https://zapier.com/apps/servicem8/integrations) via Zapier, Make, and other automation platforms. It offers an Open API and webhook support for custom integrations.

But here's what it doesn't do: answer your phone.

## The One Thing ServiceM8 Can't Do: Answer Your Phone

### ServiceM8 Manages Jobs, Not Calls

ServiceM8 is excellent at managing jobs once you have them. The challenge is getting those jobs in the first place. When a customer calls your business, ServiceM8 can't pick up. You have to answer, qualify the lead, and manually enter their information into the system.

That's fine if you're sitting at a desk. But you're not. You're in an attic. On a ladder. Under a house. Hands covered in grease, drywall mud, or worse.

### The Field Service Reality

Our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months revealed a harsh truth: field service professionals work with their hands, not their phones.

Plumbers are under sinks with water running. Electricians are in breaker boxes where safety protocols prevent phone use. HVAC technicians are on roofs installing condensers. You physically cannot answer your phone during most of your workday.

And when you can answer? You're trying to have a conversation with a potential customer while simultaneously working, which means you're either giving poor service on the call or doing poor work on the job.

### After-Hours Coverage Gap

Here's another problem: 73% of home services calls happen outside standard business hours. Customers call when their problem becomes urgentevenings, weekends, early mornings.

ServiceM8 doesn't help here either. It's job management software, not a 24/7 answering service. Calls during off-hours go straight to voicemail.

Customers don't leave detailed voicemails. They call the next contractor. Your competition answers, you lose.

## What Missed Calls Cost Field Service Contractors

### The 74.1% Problem

In our study of 13,175 calls to home services contractors, we found that 74.1% went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, here's the math:

- 42 calls/month × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
- 31 missed calls × 20% conversion rate = 6.2 lost jobs
- 6.2 lost jobs × $3,500 average job value = **$21,700 per month in lost revenue**
- Annual impact: **$260,400**

That's a quarter million dollars per year walking out the door because you couldn't answer your phone.

### Emergency Call Economics

The revenue impact is even worse for emergency calls. We found that 15.9% of all customer calls contain urgency language: "emergency," "urgent," "ASAP," "right now."

These aren't tire-kickers. These are customers with burst pipes, no power, broken AC in 95-degree heat, or heaters out in winter. Emergency jobs average $4,200significantly higher than routine service calls.

For a business receiving 42 calls monthly, that's roughly 7 emergency calls per month. Miss just one per week, and you're losing $16,800 per month in high-value work.

### Callback Requests That Never Happen

Here's another insight from our data: 25.4% of callers explicitly request a callback. "Please call me back." "Have someone call me." "I need a return call."

Without a systematic tracking system, most of these callback requests fall through the cracks. You listen to a voicemail hours later, meaning to call back, and forget. Or you write it on a sticky note that gets lost. Or you're just too busy.

The customer moves on. One plumber in our study had 76 missed calls in a single month and said, "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

Business wasn't slow. His phone just wasn't being answered.

## Call-to-Job Automation: NextPhone + ServiceM8

### The Integration Workflow

ServiceM8 is brilliant at managing jobs. NextPhone is brilliant at answering phones. Together, they create a seamless call-to-job automation system.

Here's how it works:

1. Customer calls your business number
2. NextPhone AI receptionist answers in under 5 seconds
3. AI conducts a natural conversation, asking qualifying questions
4. AI collects all data needed for a ServiceM8 job card
5. During the call, NextPhone triggers an [HTTP webhook integration](https://getnextphone.com/integrations) that sends data to [ServiceM8's Open API](https://rollout.com/integration-guides/service-m8/api-essentials)
6. ServiceM8 automatically creates a job card with customer details
7. You receive an email notification with job summary
8. Customer receives an SMS confirmation
9. Job appears instantly in your ServiceM8 mobile app

No manual data entry. No missed calls. No lost leads.

### What Happens During the Call

The [NextPhone AI receptionist](https://getnextphone.com/how-it-works) isn't a rigid phone tree. It's conversational AI trained on your business.

When a customer calls, the AI introduces itself naturally: "Hi, you've reached ABC Plumbing. I'm the AI assistant. How can I help you today?"

The AI then asks the questions you'd ask:

- What's your name?
- What service do you need?
- What's the address?
- Is this an emergency or can it wait for regular scheduling?
- What's the best phone number to reach you?

The customer answers in natural language. The AI understands, asks follow-up questions if needed, and confirms the information before ending the call.

### Automatic Job Card Creation

While the AI is still talking to the customer, it's simultaneously creating the ServiceM8 job card.

The webhook integration maps the collected data to ServiceM8 fields:

- Customer name ’ Client Name
- Phone number ’ Contact Details
- Service requested ’ Job Description
- Address ’ Job Address
- Urgency level ’ Job Status (Quote vs. Work Order) and Priority tags

By the time the call ends, the job is already in your system. You open your ServiceM8 mobile app, and there it isready to schedule.

### Emergency Call Routing

Not every call should go to AI. True emergencies need a human immediately.

NextPhone's AI is trained to recognize emergency language: "burst pipe," "no power," "gas smell," "AC not working and it's 95 degrees." When it detects urgent keywords, it routes the call to your phone instantly while simultaneously creating an urgent job card in ServiceM8.

You talk to the customer directly. You decide how quickly you can respond. Meanwhile, the job details are already captured in ServiceM8 so you don't have to scramble for a pen or try to remember everything the customer said.

Our data shows 15.9% of calls contain urgency language. That's roughly 7 emergency calls per month for a typical 42-call/month business. The integration ensures you never miss these high-value opportunities.

## Example: How It Works for a Plumbing Contractor

Let's make this concrete.

It's Monday at 7:30 PM. You're having dinner with your family. A customer's water heater starts leaking and they need help.

They call your business number. In the past, this would go to voicemail. They'd call three more plumbers before finding one who answers.

With NextPhone + ServiceM8:

**The Call:**
- NextPhone AI answers: "Hi, you've reached ABC Plumbing. I'm the AI assistant. How can I help?"
- Customer: "My water heater is leaking all over the floor."
- AI: "I'm sorry to hear that. Let me get some information. What's your name?"
- Customer: "Sarah Johnson."
- AI: "Thanks, Sarah. What's the address?"
- Customer provides address.
- AI: "Is this an emergency where we need to send someone tonight, or can we schedule for tomorrow morning?"
- Customer: "Tomorrow morning is fine. I turned off the water supply."
- AI: "Perfect. We'll have a plumber call you within two hours to confirm the appointment. You should receive a text confirmation shortly."

**Behind the Scenes:**
- ServiceM8 job card auto-created with Sarah's name, address, "water heater repair" description
- Job tagged "water heater" and "non-emergency"
- Email sent to you: "New ServiceM8 job created: Sarah Johnson - Water Heater Leak"
- SMS sent to Sarah: "We received your water heater request for 123 Main St. A plumber will call you soon to confirm appointment time."

**Your Experience:**
- You finish dinner undisturbed
- 30 minutes later, you check your email and see the new job
- You open ServiceM8 on your phone, see Sarah's job card with all details
- You call Sarah directly from the app, confirm an 8 AM appointment
- You schedule the job in ServiceM8 for your morning route

**Result:**
Customer helped. Job captured. No missed opportunity. No manual data entry. Your evening uninterrupted.
