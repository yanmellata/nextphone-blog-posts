### KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-the-fold clarity and featured snippet potential
**Word Count Target:** 80-100 words (3-6 bullets)

**Content:**

**Key Takeaways:**
- [Bullet 1: Problem] In our analysis of 13,175 calls from home services businesses, 74.1% went unansweredcosting the average contractor $260,400 per year in lost revenue
- [Bullet 2: Migration drivers] Businesses leave RingCentral due to high costs ($30-45/user/month), complex features they don't use, and poor customer service (2.2/5 Trustpilot rating)
- [Bullet 3: Reframe] Most solopreneurs and small crews don't need a full VoIP systemthey need someone to answer customer calls while they're working
- [Bullet 4: AI alternative] NextPhone's AI receptionist answers every call 24/7 for $199/month flat, compared to RingCentral's $140-200/month for 5 users (which still doesn't answer calls when you're busy)
- [Bullet 5: Migration ease] Switching to NextPhone takes 30 minutes if getting a new number, or 7-10 days if porting your existing number
- [Bullet 6: Hybrid option] You can keep RingCentral for internal team communication and add NextPhone for customer-facing calls

### INTRO (100-150 words)

**Purpose:** Hook reader and promise value
**Word Count Target:** 120-140 words

**Structure:**
1. **Hook:** Relatable contractor scenario with missed call
2. **Problem:** This is happening more than you think (data)
3. **Twist:** Maybe you don't need another VoIP system
4. **Promise:** Show you what options actually solve the problem

**Content:**

You're on a roof installing shingles. Your phone ringspotential customer calling about an emergency repair. But you can't climb down safely right now. The call goes to voicemail. By the time you check your messages two hours later, they've already booked another contractor. That's a $4,200 job gone.

This happens more than you think. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors, 74.1% went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

If you're looking to leave RingCentral, you're probably thinking about switching to another VoIP provider. But here's the thing: most solopreneurs and small crews don't actually need another phone systemthey need someone to answer their customer calls.

This guide shows you your real migration options, including a simpler (and often cheaper) alternative.

**Data/Stats:**
- 13,175 calls analyzed
- 74.1% missed call rate
- $4,200 emergency job example

### SECTION 10: Conclusion

3. **Options summary:** VoIP alternative, AI receptionist, or hybrid
4. **Decision framework:** Quick guide
5. **Hard CTA:** Start trial

**Content:**

RingCentral isn't a bad productit's just built for teams with complex communication needs. If you're a solopreneur or small crew, you're paying for features you don't use while your customer calls still go to voicemail.

In our analysis of 13,175 calls, 74.1% went unanswered. For the average contractor, that's $260,400 per year in lost revenue. The problem isn't your phone systemit's that nobody answers when you're working.

Your options: Switch to another VoIP provider (same problem, different brand), move to an AI receptionist like NextPhone ($199/month, answers 24/7), or use both (keep RingCentral for team, add NextPhone for customers).

Quick decision guide: Need team calling features? Keep VoIP. Just need customer calls answered? Try NextPhone. Want both? Hybrid approach.

The contractors capturing every call aren't the ones with the best VoIP system. They're the ones who answer every call.
