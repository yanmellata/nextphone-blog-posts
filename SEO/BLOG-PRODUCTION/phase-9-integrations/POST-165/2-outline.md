## SECTION 6: ROI Analysis: What You'll Actually Save

**Purpose:** Show concrete financial impact with transparent math
**Word Count Target:** 300-350 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Current State: What You're Losing
2. AI Receptionist Cost vs Live Answering Service
3. The Math: Payback in Under 2 Weeks

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Current loss: $260,400/year from missed calls (42 calls/mo scenario)
- Live answering cost: $500-800/mo = $6,000-9,600/year
- AI receptionist cost: $199/mo = $2,388/year
- Savings vs live service: $3,600-7,200/year
- Revenue capture: Even catching 10% of missed calls = $26,040/year
- ROI calculation: $26,040 captured / $2,388 cost = 1,091% ROI
- Payback period: Less than 2 weeks of captured calls
- Emergency calls alone justify cost: Catch 1 extra emergency/month ($4,200) = $50,400/year

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "42 calls/month × 74.1% missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 job value = $21,700/month lost"
- **Stat 2:** "NextPhone: $199/month unlimited vs PATLive: $549/month for 200 calls"
- **Stat 3:** "Catching just 10% of previously missed calls pays for the system 11x over"
- **Stat 4:** "In-house receptionist: $35,000/year + benefits vs AI: $2,388/year (93% savings)"

**Examples/Quotes:**
- ROI table: Current state / With AI / Savings
- Example: "If you're an HVAC contractor doing $500K/year, you're potentially leaving $260K on the table. A $199/month AI receptionist captures even 10% of that for $26K/year - a 13x return."

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: ROI comparison table or calculator visual
- Description: Shows cost comparison and ROI math
- Placement: After H3 subsection 2
- Alt text: "ROI comparison table showing AI receptionist cost savings for contractors"
