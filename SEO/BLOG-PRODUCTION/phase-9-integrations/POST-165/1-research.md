## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- **74.1% missed calls** ’ Use in: Opening hook, problem section, ROI calculations
- **25.4% callbacks requested** ’ Use in: Why automation matters (callback tracking)
- **15.9% urgency language** ’ Use in: Emergency routing importance for trades
- **6.2% true emergencies** ’ Use in: HVAC/plumbing emergency scenario (pipe burst, AC out)
- **42 calls/month average** ’ Use in: ROI calculation for typical contractor

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls
   ’ Use in: Problem awareness section

**Industry Examples:**
- **HVAC (2 customers):** Can't answer on ladders, summer peak seasons, AC emergencies critical
- **Plumbing (3 customers):** Under houses, hands dirty, emergency calls (pipe burst) = highest revenue
- **Electrical (5 customers):** In attics/crawl spaces, safety regulations prevent answering, power out emergencies
- **General Contractors (19 customers - PRIMARY ICP):** On job sites, can't answer, miss estimates to competitors

**ROI Calculations:**
- **Typical contractor:** 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls/month
- **If 20% convert at $3,500:** 31 × 0.20 × $3,500 = **$21,700/month lost** = **$260,400/year lost**
- **Emergency economics:** 15.9% urgent = ~7 urgent calls/month, avg $4,200 value
- **Missing 1 emergency/week:** **$16,800/month lost** = **$201,600/year lost**
- **AI receptionist cost:** $199/month (NextPhone) vs $500-800/month (traditional)
- **ROI:** $21,700 saved / $199 cost = **109x return** or **10,900% ROI**
