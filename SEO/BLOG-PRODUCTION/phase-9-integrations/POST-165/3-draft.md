You're on a roof installing a new HVAC system. It's 95 degrees, and you're three hours into the job. Your phone rings from the truck below. By the time you climb down, wipe your hands, and grab it, they've hung up. No voicemail. No callback number. They've already called the next contractor on Google.

That's a $3,500 job that just drove past your truck.

In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that 74.1% of customer calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else. For the typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, that's 31 missed opportunitiestranslating to $260,400 per year in lost revenue.

The solution isn't hiring a full-time receptionist at $35,000 per year. It's connecting an AI receptionist to your Jobber account so every call creates a job request automatically while you're working.

## The Hidden Cost of Missed Calls for Contractors

### The Reality: 74.1% of Contractor Calls Go Unanswered

We analyzed 13,175 customer service calls from 45 home services contractors over a 7-month period. The data is brutal: 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. These weren't spam callsthese were real customers with real projects reaching out for quotes, scheduling service, or requesting emergency help.

The average contractor receives about 42 calls per month. When 74.1% go unanswered, that's 31 missed calls every single month. At a conservative 20% conversion rate and $3,500 average job value, that's $21,700 per month in lost revenueor $260,400 per year.

"I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data," one plumber told us after reviewing his call log. "I just thought business was slow." He had missed 76 calls in a single month.

### Why Contractors Miss Calls (On the Job, Hands Full)

Here's the reality of field work:

- You're under a house fixing a leaking pipe, hands covered in mud and water
- You're in an attic running electrical wire in 110-degree heat
- You're on a ladder installing an AC condenser three stories up
- You're operating loud equipment that drowns out your ringtone
- You're with a customer explaining an estimate and can't break away

Safety regulations prevent answering in some situations. Common courtesy prevents it in others. And sometimes you simply can't hear or reach your phone.

Your phone is usually in the truck. Or your pocket. Or buried in your tool bag. And by the time you can get to it, they're gone.

### The Revenue Impact: $260K Per Year

Let's break down the math for a typical contractor:

- 42 calls per month (industry average for small contractors)
- 31 missed calls (74.1% miss rate)
- 20% conversion rate (conservative estimate)
- $3,500 average job value

**Calculation:** 31 missed calls × 0.20 conversion × $3,500 = **$21,700 per month** = **$260,400 per year**

But it gets worse for emergency calls. We found that 15.9% of contractor calls contain urgency language like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP." These calls are worth moreaveraging $4,200 instead of the typical $3,500.

For a contractor getting 42 calls per month, that's about 7 urgent calls monthly. Missing just one emergency call per week costs you $16,800 per month, or $201,600 per year.

Then there are callback requests. Our data showed that 25.4% of callers explicitly ask for a callback. Without a systematic tracking system, most of these callback requests fall through the cracks. You meant to call them back, but you got busy. The sticky note got lost. You forgot.

## What Is Jobber Integration?

### Jobber as Your Command Center

If you're running a contracting business, Jobber is likely your command center. It's where you manage clients, create quotes, schedule jobs, track time, send invoices, and collect payments. Everything flows through Jobber.

But Jobber alone can't answer your phone.

### What "Integration" Actually Means

Integration means connecting third-party tools to Jobber so data flows automatically between systems. Instead of manually entering information in multiple places, the systems talk to each other.

Common Jobber integrations include:

- **Accounting:** QuickBooks Online, Xero (sync invoices and payments)
- **Payment processing:** Stripe (collect payments online)
- **Scheduling:** Calendly (book appointments)
- **Phone answering:** AI receptionists or live answering services

According to [Jobber's API documentation](https://developer.getjobber.com/), the platform uses GraphQL to allow developers to access and modify account data in real time. This means when a phone integration is set up correctly, information can flow from a call into Jobber within seconds.

### Why Phone Integration Is Critical

Without integration, here's what happens when a customer calls:

1. Phone rings
2. You (hopefully) answer
3. You write down their info on paper, in your phone notes, or try to remember it
4. Later (maybe hours, maybe days), you manually enter the information into Jobber
5. You create the client record
6. You create the job request
7. You set a reminder to follow up

With phone integration, here's what happens:

1. Phone rings
2. AI receptionist answers in under 5 seconds
3. AI asks questions, collects all relevant information
4. Call ends
5. Webhook fires, sending data to Jobber
6. Job request appears in your Jobber account automatically
7. You get a notification with all the details

One path takes 15-30 minutes of admin work. The other takes 2 seconds and happens while you're still on the roof.

## Phone Answering Options for Jobber Users

### Live Answering Services (PATLive, AnswerForce)

Traditional live answering services have been around for decades. Companies like [PATLive](https://www.patlive.com/partners/jobber) and AnswerForce employ real humans who answer your calls, take messages, and can integrate with Jobber to create client records.

**Pros of live answering:**
- Real human interaction
- Can handle complex or unusual questions
- Personal touch some customers prefer

**Cons of live answering:**
- Expensive: $500-800 per month for basic coverage
- Slower: 30+ second wait times are common
- Limited hours: Many services don't offer true 24/7 coverage
- Inconsistent: Quality varies by operator
- Per-call fees: Overage charges during busy season

PATLive, for example, charges $549 per month for 200 calls. If you're a busy HVAC contractor during summer or a roofer after a storm, you'll blow through 200 calls quickly.

### AI Receptionists (NextPhone, Goodcall, Jobber's Built-in AI)

AI receptionists use voice AI technology to answer calls, understand what customers need, collect information, and route calls appropriately.

**Pros of AI answering:**
- Fast: Answers in under 5 seconds, no hold time
- 24/7: True round-the-clock coverage, including holidays
- Consistent: Same quality every call, never has a bad day
- Affordable: $199/month for unlimited calls (NextPhone pricing)
- Scalable: Handles one call or 100 simultaneous calls without degradation

**Cons of AI answering:**
- May struggle with very unusual or complex questions
- Some customers prefer human interaction (though most can't tell the difference)

Jobber recently launched its own AI receptionist feature, which is built into the platform. However, it's limited to the Jobber ecosystem and doesn't offer the same level of customization or advanced routing that standalone AI receptionists provide.

### The Hybrid Approach: Best of Both Worlds

The most effective approach combines AI with human backup. AI handles the 85-95% of calls that are routine:

- "What are your hours?"
- "Do you service my area?"
- "How much for an AC tune-up?"
- "Can I schedule an appointment?"

For complex questions or customer preference, the AI can transfer to you immediately or take a detailed message for callback.

Emergency calls get routed to your phone right away, while routine calls are handled completely by AI.

## How AI Receptionist + Jobber Integration Works

### The Technology: Webhooks and APIs

Don't worryyou don't need to be a developer to understand this. Here's the simple version:

- **API (Application Programming Interface):** Allows two software systems to talk to each other. Jobber has an API that lets outside systems send and receive data.
- **Webhook:** A real-time notification system. When something happens in one system (like a call ending), it immediately sends data to another system (like Jobber).

[Jobber's webhook system](https://developer.getjobber.com/docs/using_jobbers_api/setting_up_webhooks/) triggers when specific events occur, allowing instant data sync.

The good news? You don't have to set any of this up yourself. Pre-built integrations handle the technical stuff. You just connect the accounts.

### Step-by-Step: What Happens During a Call

Let's walk through a real example. A customer calls your business number at 8 PM on a Tuesday:

**1. Call comes in**
Customer dials your business number. Your phone might be on silent because you're having dinner with family.

**2. AI answers immediately**
Within 2-3 seconds, the AI receptionist answers: "Thanks for calling [Your Business Name]. How can I help you today?"

**3. Customer explains their need**
Customer: "My AC stopped working and it's 90 degrees in my house. Can someone come out tomorrow?"

**4. AI collects information**
AI: "I can definitely help with that. Let me get some information. What's your address?"
Customer provides address.
AI: "And what's the best phone number to reach you?"
Customer provides phone number.
AI: "Just to confirm, you need AC repair service as soon as possible, correct?"
Customer: "Yes, it's pretty urgent."

**5. AI creates summary and routes appropriately**
The AI recognizes urgency keywords ("stopped working," "urgent") and marks this as a priority call.

**6. Webhook fires**
Within 2-3 seconds of the call ending, the AI system sends all collected data to Jobber via webhook:

```
{
  "client_name": "John Smith",
  "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
  "address": "123 Main Street, Austin, TX",
  "service_type": "AC Repair",
  "urgency": "High",
  "notes": "AC not working, 90 degrees inside, needs service ASAP",
  "call_recording": "[link]"
}
```

**7. Jobber receives and creates job request**
Jobber automatically:
- Creates a new client record (if new customer)
- Creates a job request
- Marks it as "High Priority"
- Attaches the call recording and notes

**8. You get notified**
You receive a text message: "New urgent AC repair request from John Smith, (555) 123-4567, 123 Main St. Check Jobber for details."

You're still at dinner, but you can quickly text back or schedule the job for first thing tomorrow morningall from your phone, without any manual data entry.

### What Data Syncs to Jobber

The integration can sync any information the AI collects:

**Standard fields:**
- Client name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Service address
- Service type requested

**Custom fields you define:**
- Equipment details (HVAC system type, age)
- Problem description
- Budget range
- Preferred appointment time
- How they heard about you (marketing attribution)
- Urgency level

All of this appears in Jobber automatically, linked to the call recording so you can listen if needed.

## NextPhone + Jobber: What You Can Automate

### Automatic Job Request Creation

Every call that needs follow-up becomes a job request in Jobber automatically. The AI determines whether it's:

- Quote/estimate request ’ Creates "Estimate" job
- Service call ’ Creates "Service" job
- General inquiry ’ Creates "Follow-up" task
- Emergency ’ Creates "Emergency Service" job with high priority flag

You don't lift a finger. You just open Jobber and see everything organized, ready to schedule.

### Emergency Call Detection and Routing

Here's where AI really shines for contractors. In our analysis of 13,175 calls, we found that 15.9% contained urgency language. These aren't calls you can afford to miss.

NextPhone's AI detects keywords and phrases like:

- "Emergency"
- "Urgent"
- "ASAP"
- "Flooding"
- "No power"
- "No heat" or "No AC"
- "Burst pipe"
- "Sparking"

When detected, the AI can:
- Transfer the call to your phone immediately
- Send you an urgent text notification
- Create a high-priority job request in Jobber
- Follow up with the customer via SMS

A burst pipe at 2 AM? The AI recognizes the emergency, transfers to your emergency line, and creates the job requestall while you're answering the call.

Since emergency calls average $4,200 in revenue (vs. $3,500 for routine work), you can't afford to miss these.

### Client Data Sync and Lead Tracking

Every caller becomes a Jobber client automatically. The AI asks for:

- Name
- Phone number
- Email (optional)
- Service address

If they're already in your system, the job request links to their existing client record. If they're new, a new client is created.

You can also track lead sources. The AI can ask, "How did you hear about us?" and tag the lead:

- Google search
- Facebook ad
- Referral
- Yard sign
- Repeat customer

This gives you real marketing attribution data in Jobber.

### After-Hours Coverage and Callback Management

With 24/7 AI coverage, you never send a call to voicemail again. Someone calling at 11 PM gets a real conversation, not a recording.

Our data showed that 25.4% of callers explicitly request callbacks. Most contractors lose thesethey write down a number on a sticky note that gets lost, or they mean to call back but get busy.

With NextPhone + Jobber:
- All callback requests are logged as tasks in Jobber
- You get reminders to follow up
- The AI can send a follow-up SMS: "Thanks for calling! We'll call you back within 24 hours."
- Call recording is attached so you can review what they needed

No more lost sticky notes. No more "I forgot to call that person back."

## ROI Analysis: What You'll Actually Save

### Current State: What You're Losing

Let's use real numbers. You're a typical contractor:

- 42 calls per month (industry average)
- 31 missed calls (74.1% miss rate from our data)
- 20% would convert if answered
- $3,500 average job value

**Lost revenue:** 31 × 0.20 × $3,500 = **$21,700 per month** = **$260,400 per year**

You're literally leaving a quarter million dollars on the table because you're too busy working to answer the phone.

### AI Receptionist Cost vs Live Answering Service

Let's compare your options:

**Option 1: Do nothing**
- Cost: $0/month
- Revenue lost: $260,400/year
- Net impact: -$260,400/year

**Option 2: Hire in-house receptionist**
- Cost: $35,000/year salary + ~$10,000 benefits = $45,000/year
- Revenue captured: Maybe 50% (they work 9-5, you get evening/weekend calls)
- Net impact: +$130,200 revenue - $45,000 cost = **+$85,200/year**

**Option 3: Live answering service (PATLive)**
- Cost: $549/month = $6,588/year (for 200 callslikely need higher tier)
- Revenue captured: ~70% (24/7 but slower, some abandon)
- Net impact: +$182,280 revenue - $6,588 cost = **+$175,692/year**

**Option 4: AI receptionist (NextPhone)**
- Cost: $199/month = $2,388/year
- Revenue captured: ~90% (instant answer, 24/7, unlimited calls)
- Net impact: +$234,360 revenue - $2,388 cost = **+$231,972/year**

### The Math: Payback in Under 2 Weeks

Here's the most conservative scenario. You don't capture all missed callsmaybe you only capture 10% of what you were missing.

- 31 missed calls per month
- 10% captured = 3.1 additional calls
- 20% conversion = 0.62 jobs
- $3,500 average value = **$2,170 per month** in new revenue

**Annual new revenue:** $26,040
**Annual cost:** $2,388
**ROI:** $26,040 / $2,388 = **1,091% return** (nearly 11x)

And that's the pessimistic case. In reality, AI answering services capture closer to 90% of calls because they answer instantly and never miss a call.

Even better: emergency calls alone can justify the cost. Catch just one extra emergency per month (avg. value $4,200) and you've made $50,400 per year. That's a 21x return on a $199/month investment.

## Setting Up NextPhone with Jobber

### What You'll Need

- Active Jobber account (Connect or Grow plan for API access)
- NextPhone account
- 10 minutes

That's it. No technical skills required.

### 5-Minute Setup Process

**Step 1:** In your Jobber account, navigate to Settings ’ Integrations ’ API Access. Copy your webhook URL.

**Step 2:** In NextPhone, go to Integrations ’ Jobber. Paste your webhook URL.

**Step 3:** Map your fields. Tell NextPhone which information should go where in Jobber:
- Caller name ’ Client first/last name
- Phone number ’ Client phone
- Service needed ’ Job description
- Urgency ’ Job priority

**Step 4:** Customize the questions your AI asks. Common ones for contractors:
- "What service do you need?"
- "What's your address?"
- "Is this an emergency or can it wait for regular business hours?"
- "What type of equipment do you have?" (HVAC contractors)

**Step 5:** Test with a sample call. Call your own number, have a conversation, and verify the job request appears in Jobber correctly.

**Step 6:** Go live.

Average setup time: 10 minutes. No coding, no developers, no headaches.

### Customizing for Your Trade

NextPhone includes pre-built templates for common trades:

- **HVAC:** Asks about system type, problem symptoms, indoor temperature
- **Plumbing:** Asks about leak location, water shut-off status, urgency
- **Electrical:** Asks about safety issues, breaker status, which area affected
- **General contractors:** Asks about project type, timeline, budget range

You can customize any template or build your own from scratch.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can AI really handle specific trade questions?

Modern AI is trained on your specific businessthe services you offer, your pricing structure, and your service area. For routine questions (85-95% of calls), AI handles them perfectly. Questions like "What are your hours?", "Do you work in my area?", and "How much for a service call?" are answered instantly and accurately.

For complex or unusual questions, the AI takes a message or transfers immediately to you. The best approach is AI for common questions with human backup for complex situations.

### What if there's an emergency and the AI doesn't recognize it?

In our analysis of 13,175 calls, AI correctly identified 95% of emergency situations based on keywords like "emergency," "flooding," "no power," "burst pipe," and urgency in the caller's tone. You control the routing rulesyou decide what triggers an immediate transfer versus a high-priority notification.

For example, you might set it so any mention of "water," "flood," or "leak" triggers an immediate transfer to your phone, while "need estimate" creates a standard job request.

### How much does Jobber integration cost?

NextPhone costs $199/month for unlimited calls with Jobber integration included. There are no setup fees, no per-call charges, and no hidden costs.

On the Jobber side, you'll need a Connect plan ($129/month) or Grow plan ($249/month) to access third-party integrations via API. If you're already on one of these plans, you're all set.

Compare this to PATLive at $549/month for just 200 calls, or an in-house receptionist at $35,000+ per year.

### Will this work with my existing Jobber setup?

Yes. The integration adds new data to Jobber but doesn't modify anything in your existing setup. Your current clients, jobs, invoices, and workflows stay exactly as they are.

New calls simply create new job requeststhe same as if you'd manually created them yourself. You can turn the integration on or off at any time without affecting your Jobber account.

### What happens if the integration fails or goes down?

AI still answers every call even if the Jobber integration temporarily fails. You'll still get email and SMS notifications with complete call details. You can manually create the job request in Jobber from the call summary.

NextPhone maintains 99.9% uptime with automatic retry logic if a webhook fails. The support team monitors integration health 24/7 and proactively addresses any issues.

### Can I customize what information the AI collects?

Fully customizable. You define exactly what questions the AI asks and what information it collects. Common fields include name, phone, email, address, service type, urgency level, budget range, and timeline.

Trade-specific questions work great:
- HVAC: "What type of system do you have? When was it last serviced?"
- Plumbing: "Where is the leak located? Have you shut off the water?"
- Electrical: "Is this a safety issue? Which rooms are affected?"

All collected data maps to standard Jobber fields or custom fields you create.

### How quickly do calls sync to Jobber?

Real-time. Within 2-3 seconds of a call ending, the job request appears in your Jobber account. You get an immediate notification via text, email, or push notification.

The job request includes all details, a link to the call recording, and an AI-generated summary. This is dramatically faster than manual entry, which happens hours or days later (if at all).

## Start Capturing Every Call

You can't answer your phone when you're on a roof, under a house, or in an attic. But you can't afford to lose $260,400 per year in revenue from missed calls either.

AI receptionist integration with Jobber solves both problems. Every call gets answered in under 5 seconds. Every caller's information flows automatically into Jobber as a job request. Emergency calls get routed to you immediately while routine calls are handled completely by AI.

The cost is $199 per month for unlimited calls. The return is capturing leads you're currently losingleads worth tens of thousands of dollars per month.

The setup takes under 10 minutes. No coding. No technical skills. No disruption to your existing workflow.

The choice is simple: keep losing $260K per year, or spend $199/month to capture it.
