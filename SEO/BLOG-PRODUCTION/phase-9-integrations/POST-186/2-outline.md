- The data: 74.1% of calls missed (from 13,175 call analysis)
- Power users love ClickUp's hierarchy, custom fields, automation
- But phone calls still require manual task creation
- Promise: This post shows how to automate phone ’ ClickUp workflow

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Scenario: "You're on a roof installing shingles. Phone rings. It's a customer asking for an estimate. You can't answer. Later, you remember to call backbut now you need to create a ClickUp task, fill in custom fields, set priority, assign it. Five minutes gone."

**Purpose:** Identify the problemphone calls don't automatically become tasks
**Word Count Target:** 150-200 words

**H2 Title:** The Missing Piece: Phone Call Integration

**H3 Subsections:**
1. What Exists Today

- Existing: RingCentral, Phone.com via Zapier (basic, manual setup)
- Problem: These don't automatically create tasks with custom fields
- Typical workflow: Answer call ’ remember details ’ manually create task ’ fill custom fields ’ set priority
- This breaks the automation that power users rely on

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "25.4% of customers explicitly request callbacks (632 calls out of 2,487)" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Stat 2:** "15.9% of calls contain urgency language" - Source: NextPhone factbase

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Simple flowchart showing broken workflow
- Placement: After "The Manual Workflow Problem"

- **Money saved:** 85 mins × $50/hour labor = $71/month in manual work. Plus revenue from 31 previously missed calls.
- **Revenue captured:** 31 missed calls × 20% conversion × $3,500 avg job = $21,700/month potential
