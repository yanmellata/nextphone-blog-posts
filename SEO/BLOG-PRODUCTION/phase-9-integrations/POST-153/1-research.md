## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What 8x8 is (UCaaS/contact center platform)
2. 8x8's integration capabilities (CRM, APIs)
3. Target market (enterprise, mid-sized businesses)
4. Key features (unified communications, contact center)
5. Pricing overview (per-user model)

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **SMB Cost Angle** - Competitors: Focus on enterprise pricing and features, We'll do: Show how 8x8's per-user cost ($15-35/user) adds up vs NextPhone's $199 flat rate for small teams
2. **AI Layer Integration** - Competitors: Position as 8x8 alternatives, We'll do: Position NextPhone as complementary AI answering layer that works WITH 8x8
3. **Missed Call Data** - Competitors: Generic stats or no data, We'll do: Lead with 74.1% missed call stat showing problem persists even with UCaaS platforms
4. **Real Integration How-To** - Competitors: Vague or enterprise-focused, We'll do: Show specific ways NextPhone integrates (webhooks, call forwarding, CRM sync)
5. **Hybrid Approach** - Competitors: Either/or thinking, We'll do: NextPhone handles front-line + routes to 8x8 for complex calls

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Most businesses using 8x8 still miss 74% of calls because UCaaS platforms require humans to answer. NextPhone acts as an AI front-line layer that answers every call in under 5 seconds, handles routine inquiries (hours, pricing, scheduling), and seamlessly routes complex or urgent calls to your 8x8 system. At $199/month flat rate vs $15-35 per user, it's the affordable AI upgrade for 8x8 users who can't afford 24/7 staffing."

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More SMB-focused:** Show cost comparison for 3-10 person teams (target market)
2. **More data-driven:** Use 13,175 call analysis vs generic industry stats
3. **More practical:** Specific integration methods vs vague "it integrates"
4. **Better positioned:** Complement to 8x8, not replacement (less threatening)
5. **Clearer ROI:** Show math on cost savings + captured revenue
