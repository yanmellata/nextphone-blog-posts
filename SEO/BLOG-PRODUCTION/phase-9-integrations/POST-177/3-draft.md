---

A customer calls at 7 PM needing emergency HVAC repair. You're finishing a job and miss the call. They hire the next contractor who answered. You lost $3,500. Then you spend 15 minutes entering yesterday's customers into QuickBooks manually.

This happens more often than you think. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. And 6.9% of all calls are quote requestsmissing just 3 per month costs $126,000 per year.

QuickBooks integration solves both problems: capture every call AND eliminate manual data entry.

## What is QuickBooks Integration?

QuickBooks integration connects your business apps to QuickBooks, automatically syncing customer data, invoices, payments, and financial records between systems. Instead of entering the same customer information in three different places (your phone notes, your CRM, and QuickBooks), integration does it onceautomatically.

### The Integration Ecosystem

[QuickBooks integrates with over 800 popular business apps](https://quickbooks.intuit.com/online/integrations/)CRM systems, payment processors, time tracking tools, invoicing platforms, and phone systems. These integrations eliminate the manual copy-paste work that eats up 15-20 hours per month for most small business owners.

The ecosystem covers everything from e-commerce platforms like Shopify to project management tools like Monday.com. [3.7 million businesses use QuickBooks Desktop](https://www.apideck.com/blog/build-an-integration-with-quickbooks-desktop-in-2025), with millions more on QuickBooks Online. The integration options have exploded over the past five years as QuickBooks opened their API to third-party developers.

### How Integration Works (API, Webhooks, Sync)

QuickBooks integrations work through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)secure connections that let apps talk to each other. When you connect an app to QuickBooks, you authorize it using OAuth (a secure login method), and the two systems start exchanging data.

There are two types of sync:

- **Real-time sync:** Data transfers instantly (within seconds of creation)
- **Batch sync:** Data transfers on a schedule (hourly, daily)

For service businesses, real-time sync matters. When you book a job at 8 PM, you want that customer in QuickBooks immediatelynot tomorrow morning.

### Real-Time vs Batch Syncing

Real-time syncing means when the AI phone system captures a customer's name and phone number, it creates the QuickBooks customer record within 5 seconds. The contractor can open QuickBooks on their phone and see the new customer before the call even ends.

Batch syncing waits. Your call answering system might collect 20 customers throughout the day, then push them all to QuickBooks at midnight. By then, you've forgotten half the details, and the customer has already hired someone else.

For contractors, plumbers, and electricians competing on response time, real-time sync wins jobs.

## Why QuickBooks Integration Matters for Service Businesses

You're under a sink fixing a leak. Your phone ringsit's a new customer asking for a quote on a bathroom remodel worth $8,000. You can't answer because your hands are covered in pipe gunk.

Without integration, here's what happens: The call goes to voicemail. Maybe you call them back tonight. Maybe tomorrow. You scribble their info on a receipt. Later, you manually type it into QuickBooks. You forget to follow up. They hire someone else.

With integration, the AI answers the call, captures their information, creates the QuickBooks customer record, and schedules a callback for youall before you've finished the repair.

### Eliminate Double Data Entry

The average contractor enters the same customer information in 2-3 places:

- Written notes (job site notepad or phone notes app)
- Scheduling or CRM system
- QuickBooks for invoicing

That's 5-10 minutes per customer. With 15-20 new customers per week, you're spending 2-3 hours every week on data entry. Over a year, that's 104-156 hoursnearly a month of work timejust copying information between systems.

Integration cuts this to zero. Customer calls, AI captures info, QuickBooks customer record created. One step, one second.

### Capture Revenue You're Currently Losing

We analyzed 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months. The data is brutal: 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, 31 calls go to voicemail. If 6.9% of those are quote requests (based on our data), you're missing 3 quote requests every month. At an average project value of $3,500, that's $10,500 per month in lost revenue$126,000 per year.

"I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data," one plumber told us after reviewing his call log. "I just thought business was slow."

### Get Paid Faster with Automated Invoicing

Manual invoicing is slow. You finish a job Tuesday morning. Tuesday night you're exhausted and skip the paperwork. Wednesday you create the invoice. Thursday you email it. The customer pays two weeks later.

With QuickBooks integration, the invoice is created the moment you mark the job complete. The customer receives it within minuteswhile they're still thinking about the great work you just did. [Companies using invoice automation reduce their invoice-to-cash cycle by two weeks on average and reduce bad debt by up to 30%](https://www.invoiced.com/product/integrations/quickbooks).

[80% of businesses with automatic invoicing in QuickBooks report improved cash flow and faster payment collection](https://www.depositfix.com/blog/quickbooks-automation). Getting paid two weeks earlier doesn't just improve cash flowit changes how you run your business.

## Types of QuickBooks Integrations

QuickBooks doesn't come with built-in CRM, scheduling, or phone answering. [QuickBooks is accounting software and doesn't have built-in CRM functionalities](https://www.bigcontacts.com/blog/quickbooks-crm-integration/)it's designed to be used with third-party tools that handle those jobs.

Here are the main integration categories:

| Integration Type | Purpose | Examples | Key Benefit |
|-----------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| CRM | Customer relationship management | Method, HubSpot, Salesforce | Two-way customer data sync |
| Invoicing | Accounts receivable automation | Invoiced, FreshBooks | Faster payment collection |
| Payments | Accounts payable automation | Bill.com, AvidXchange | Streamlined bill payment |
| Time Tracking | Project hours & billing | QuickBooks Time, Harvest | Accurate time-based invoicing |
| Phone Systems | Inbound lead capture | Ooma, NextPhone | Creates customers from calls |

### CRM Integrations (Customer Management)

CRM integrations like Method CRM or HubSpot sync your customer database with QuickBooks. When you add a new contact in your CRM, they appear in QuickBooks automatically. When you close a deal, the invoice is created in QuickBooks without manual entry.

The best CRM integrations are two-way: create a customer in QuickBooks, and they show up in your CRM. Update their email in the CRM, and QuickBooks reflects the change.

### Invoicing & Accounts Receivable

Invoicing integrations automate the billing process. They can send recurring invoices, track which customers haven't paid, send automatic payment reminders, and accept online paymentsall synced to QuickBooks.

For service businesses, this means you can create an invoice template for "Emergency Plumbing Service" and have it auto-populate whenever you complete that type of job.

### Payment Processing & Accounts Payable

Payment integrations like Bill.com handle vendor bills and outgoing payments. They can scan invoices, route them for approval, schedule payments, and sync everything to QuickBooks automatically.

For contractors juggling multiple suppliers and subcontractors, this prevents missed payments and late fees.

### Time Tracking & Project Management

Time tracking integrations like QuickBooks Time (formerly TSheets) let employees clock in and out from their phones. Hours sync to QuickBooks and populate invoices automaticallyno manual timesheet entry.

For contractors billing by the hour or tracking project costs, this integration is essential for accurate invoicing.

### Phone System Integration (NEW - Our Focus)

Here's the integration category most QuickBooks guides ignore: phone systems.

Traditional phone integrations like [Ooma offer caller ID pop-ups](https://www.ooma.com/small-business-phone-systems/integrations/quickbooks/) that show customer information when they call. That's useful if the customer already exists in QuickBooks.

But what about NEW customers calling for the first time?

AI phone systems create QuickBooks customer records from inbound callscapturing name, phone, email, service requested, and urgency level. The customer record exists in QuickBooks before you even call them back.

This is the gap most integrations miss: they sync existing data but don't create new customers from phone inquiries.

## The Lead-to-Billable Workflow: From Phone Call to Invoice

Most QuickBooks integrations assume the customer already exists in your system. They're designed to sync CRM contacts or e-commerce ordersdata that's already digital.

Service businesses are different. Most new customers call you. And most of those calls happen when you're on a ladder, under a house, or elbow-deep in an electrical panel.

### Traditional Workflow (Manual, Error-Prone)

Here's the old way:

1. Phone rings while you're working
2. Call goes to voicemail
3. You listen to voicemail later (maybe)
4. You call back (if you remember)
5. You write customer info on paper or in phone notes
6. You enter info into your CRM or scheduling system
7. You copy that info into QuickBooks
8. You create an invoice manually
9. You email the invoice (if you remember)

Eight steps. Multiple opportunities for information to get lost. Hours of manual work every week.

### Automated Workflow (Integration-Powered)

Here's the new way with AI phone answering + QuickBooks integration:

1. Phone rings, AI answers in under 5 seconds
2. AI captures customer name, phone, email, service request
3. AI creates QuickBooks customer record automatically
4. AI maps service request to your QuickBooks service items
5. System generates estimate and emails it to customer

Four steps. No manual work. Customer has their estimate before you've finished the current job.

### Why This Matters for Service Businesses

In our analysis of 2,487 customer interactions, 25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks. Without a tracking system, 80% of callback requests never happen. That's 9 lost leads per month for a business getting 42 calls.

At a 30% conversion rate and $3,500 average project value, those lost callbacks cost $9,450 per month$113,400 per year.

The lead-to-billable workflow captures these calls automatically. No callback gets forgotten. No customer record gets lost in your truck's glovebox.

## Service Item Mapping: How Service Requests Become QuickBooks Items

When a customer calls and says "my AC isn't working," how does that become a line item on a QuickBooks invoice?

Service item mapping is the bridge between what the customer says and what shows up in QuickBooks.

### What Are QuickBooks Service Items?

QuickBooks service items are the products or services you sell. They include:

- Service description ("Emergency HVAC Repair")
- Default rate ($175 diagnostic fee + $135/hour labor)
- Income account (where revenue is tracked)
- Tax settings (taxable or non-taxable)

When you create an invoice, you select service items to add as line items. Each item auto-fills with the description and rate you've configured.

### Mapping Service Requests to Items

AI phone systems can map customer requests to your QuickBooks service items automatically:

- Customer says: "I have a burst pipe, water everywhere!"
- AI detects: Emergency plumbing needed
- System maps to: QuickBooks item "Emergency Plumbing Service" ($150/hour, 2-hour minimum)
- Invoice line item auto-populated: "Emergency Plumbing Service - 2 hrs @ $150/hr = $300"

The mapping is customizable. You define which customer phrases trigger which service items. You can create mappings for:

- **Emergency vs. routine** (different rates)
- **Residential vs. commercial** (different pricing tiers)
- **Service types** (diagnostic, repair, installation, maintenance)
- **Seasonal services** (AC repair, furnace maintenance)

### Examples by Trade

**Plumbing:**
- "Burst pipe" � "Emergency Plumbing - Hourly" @ $150/hr
- "Water heater replacement" � "Water Heater Installation" @ $2,500 flat
- "Drain cleaning" � "Drain Service - Standard" @ $125

**HVAC:**
- "AC not cooling" � "Emergency HVAC Diagnostic" @ $175 + $135/hr labor
- "Furnace maintenance" � "Furnace Tune-Up" @ $199 flat
- "New AC unit" � "AC Installation - Residential" @ quote pricing

**Electrical:**
- "No power" � "Emergency Electrical Service" @ $175/hr
- "Panel upgrade" � "Electrical Panel Replacement" @ quote pricing
- "Outlet installation" � "Electrical Repair - Standard" @ $95/hr

**General Contractor:**
- "Bathroom remodel estimate" � "Residential Estimate - Bathroom" @ $0 (free estimate)
- "Deck repair" � "Exterior Carpentry - Repair" @ $85/hr
- "Kitchen renovation" � "Residential Estimate - Kitchen" @ $0

The service item mapping happens automatically during the call. By the time you call the customer back, QuickBooks already has their info and the appropriate service items queued up.

## Automation Triggers: What Happens Automatically

QuickBooks integration isn't just about syncing datait's about triggering actions based on events.

An automation trigger is an event that causes something to happen in QuickBooks automatically. Here are the most powerful triggers for service businesses:

### Call-Based Triggers

**Trigger:** Call completes with customer contact info captured
**Action:** Creates QuickBooks customer record with name, phone, email, address

**Trigger:** Caller requests quote or estimate
**Action:** Generates QuickBooks estimate with appropriate service items, emails to customer

**Trigger:** Emergency service requested (detected by keywords like "urgent," "ASAP," "emergency")
**Action:** Creates high-priority job in QuickBooks, sends immediate notification to contractor

In our analysis, 15.9% of calls contained urgency language. For a business getting 42 calls per month, that's 7 urgent calls. Missing even one emergency call means losing a high-value job (average $4,200 for emergency work vs $3,500 for routine).

### Appointment-Based Triggers

**Trigger:** Appointment scheduled by caller
**Action 1:** Creates QuickBooks customer if new
**Action 2:** Adds appointment to calendar
**Action 3:** Creates preliminary estimate
**Action 4:** Sends confirmation email with estimate attached

7.7% of calls are scheduling requests. For a 42-call/month business, that's 323 appointments per year. Automating this process saves 5-10 minutes per appointment27-54 hours annually.

### Estimate-Based Triggers

**Trigger:** Customer approves estimate (via email link or phone call)
**Action:** Converts estimate to invoice automatically, sends invoice email, schedules payment reminders

**Trigger:** Job marked complete by contractor
**Action:** Finalizes invoice with actual hours/materials, sends to customer immediately

Here's a complete workflow example:

**Monday, 3:15 PM** - Sarah calls needing electrical panel upgrade
**Trigger:** Call completed � Customer "Sarah Johnson" created in QuickBooks

**Monday, 3:17 PM** - AI books appointment for Thursday 9 AM
**Trigger:** Appointment scheduled � Estimate for "Electrical Panel Upgrade - 200A" created and emailed to Sarah

**Thursday, 9:00 AM** - Electrician arrives, assesses job
**Trigger:** Estimate approved by Sarah � Converted to invoice in QuickBooks

**Thursday, 2:30 PM** - Job completed
**Trigger:** Contractor marks complete � Invoice finalized with actual labor hours (5.5 hrs @ $95/hr = $522.50), emailed to Sarah automatically

**Thursday, 2:31 PM** - Sarah receives invoice, pays online
**Trigger:** Payment received � QuickBooks records payment, marks invoice paid

Zero manual QuickBooks work. The contractor focused on the electrical work. The system handled the rest.

## ROI for Service Businesses: What You Gain

Let's talk real numbers. What's the actual return on investing in QuickBooks integration?

### Revenue Capture: Stop Losing Calls

**General Contractor Scenario:**
- Average: 42 calls/month
- Missed: 74.1% = 31 missed calls/month
- Quote requests: 6.9% of missed calls = 3 quote requests lost/month
- Average project: $3,500
- **Lost revenue: 3 � $3,500 = $10,500/month = $126,000/year**

**With NextPhone + QuickBooks:**
- Cost: $199/month � 12 = $2,388/year
- Capture just 1 extra job every 5 months to break even
- **ROI: 5,275%** (or $123,612 net gain annually)

**Emergency Plumber Scenario:**
- Average: 42 calls/month
- Urgent calls: 15.9% = 7 emergency calls/month
- Missed: 74.1% of urgent = 5 emergency calls lost/month
- Average emergency job: $4,200
- **Lost revenue: 5 � $4,200 = $21,000/month = $252,000/year**

**With NextPhone + QuickBooks:**
- Capture just 1 emergency call per month = $4,200 revenue
- Cost: $199/month
- **Net gain per month: $4,001**
- **Monthly ROI: 2,011%**

| Scenario | Missed Calls/Month | Lost Revenue/Year | NextPhone Cost/Year | Net Gain | ROI |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------|-----|
| General Contractor | 31 (3 quotes) | $126,000 | $2,388 | $123,612 | 5,275% |
| Emergency Plumber | 31 (5 emergencies) | $252,000 | $2,388 | $249,612 | 10,455% |
| HVAC Technician | 31 (mixed) | $189,000 | $2,388 | $186,612 | 7,818% |

### Time Savings: Eliminate Manual Entry

Manual QuickBooks entry takes time:

- 5 minutes per customer � 20 customers/week = 100 minutes/week
- 100 minutes/week � 52 weeks = 5,200 minutes/year = **87 hours annually**
- At $50/hour contractor rate = **$4,350/year in labor cost**

Plus benefits you can't easily measure:
- No data entry errors (typos, duplicate customers)
- No forgotten invoices
- No lost customer information
- Consistent service item pricing (no accidentally charging $95 instead of $125)

### Cash Flow: Get Paid Faster

Manual invoicing timeline:
- Complete job Tuesday � Create invoice Thursday � Email Friday � Customer pays 2 weeks later
- **Invoice-to-cash cycle: 16-17 days**

Automated invoicing timeline:
- Complete job Tuesday 2 PM � Invoice created 2:05 PM � Customer receives 2:06 PM � Customer pays 1 week later
- **Invoice-to-cash cycle: 7-8 days**

Getting paid 50% faster means:
- Better cash flow (less need for business credit)
- Fewer late payments (invoice arrives while work is fresh in customer's mind)
- [30% reduction in bad debt](https://www.invoiced.com/product/integrations/quickbooks) (per Invoiced study)

For a contractor doing $500,000/year in revenue, improving cash flow by 9 days is like having an extra $12,329 in the bank at all times.

## How NextPhone + QuickBooks Integration Works

NextPhone connects to QuickBooks using HTTP webhooksa simple, secure way to send data from one system to another whenever an event happens.

### Setup (5 Minutes with HTTP Webhooks)

Setting up the integration takes about 5 minutes:

1. **Get your QuickBooks API credentials** (OAuth token from QuickBooks Developer)
2. **Configure NextPhone webhook** (paste QuickBooks API URL, add authentication)
3. **Map fields** (AI "customer_name" � QuickBooks "Display Name", AI "phone" � QB "Primary Phone")
4. **Define service item mappings** (emergency � "Emergency Service", routine � "Standard Service")
5. **Test** (make a test call, verify customer appears in QuickBooks)

No coding required. If you can copy-paste a URL, you can set up the integration.

### The Complete Workflow

Here's what happens when a customer calls:

**Step 1: Call Answered**
- Phone rings
- NextPhone AI answers in under 5 seconds
- AI: "Thanks for calling ABC Plumbing, this is the AI assistant. How can I help you today?"

**Step 2: Information Collected**
- AI asks: Name, phone number, email, service needed, urgency, preferred date/time
- AI captures: "Mike Chen, (555) 123-4567, mike@email.com, AC not cooling, urgent, today if possible"
- AI detects urgency keywords ("urgent," "today")

**Step 3: QuickBooks Customer Created**
- AI posts to QuickBooks API via webhook
- Customer record created:
  - Name: Mike Chen
  - Phone: (555) 123-4567
  - Email: mike@email.com
  - Tags: "Urgent," "HVAC," "New Customer"

**Step 4: Service Item Mapped**
- AI matches "AC not cooling" + "urgent" to service mapping
- Selects QuickBooks item: "Emergency HVAC Diagnostic" ($175) + "HVAC Repair - Hourly" ($135/hr)

**Step 5: Estimate Generated**
- QuickBooks creates estimate with:
  - Line 1: Emergency HVAC Diagnostic - $175
  - Line 2: HVAC Repair - 2 hrs @ $135/hr = $270
  - Total estimate: $445

**Step 6: Customer Notified**
- Email sent to Mike with estimate attached
- SMS sent: "Thanks for calling ABC Plumbing! Technician will arrive between 2-4 PM today. Estimate attached to email."

**Step 7: Contractor Sees Everything**
- Contractor opens QuickBooks mobile app
- Sees new customer "Mike Chen" with estimate ready
- Calls Mike to confirm time
- Arrives at job with all details in QuickBooks

### What Gets Synced Automatically

**Customer Data:**
- Name (first and last)
- Phone number (mobile and alternate)
- Email address
- Physical address (if provided)
- Preferred contact method
- Customer type (residential, commercial)

**Job Information:**
- Service type requested
- Urgency level
- Preferred date/time
- Budget or price expectations
- Special notes or instructions

**Financial Data:**
- Service items (from mapping)
- Estimated hours or flat rate
- Materials needed (if discussed)
- Estimate total

**Follow-Up:**
- Scheduled callback time
- Appointment date/time
- Next action needed

The integration is two-way: NextPhone can also pull existing customer data from QuickBooks. If Mike Chen calls back next month, the AI recognizes his phone number, pulls his QuickBooks record, and greets him by name.

## Frequently Asked Questions About QuickBooks Integration

### Does this work with QuickBooks Desktop or just Online?

Most modern integrations support QuickBooks Online because it's cloud-based and has easier API access. QuickBooks Desktop can integrate but typically requires additional middleware software like SyncPro or a connector app.

Intuit stopped selling QuickBooks Desktop Pro and Premier in July 2024, though Enterprise is still available and [3.7 million businesses still use Desktop versions](https://www.apideck.com/blog/build-an-integration-with-quickbooks-desktop-in-2025). If you're on Desktop, you can still integratejust expect an extra setup step.

For new users, QuickBooks Online is the better choice for integration simplicity.

### Do I need a developer to set up the integration?

No. Most integrations today use OAuth ("click to connect") authentication. You authorize the app to access your QuickBooks account, then configure field mapping through a simple web interface.

For NextPhone + QuickBooks specifically:
1. Paste your QuickBooks API URL into NextPhone settings
2. Add your OAuth token (copy-paste)
3. Map fields (drag-and-drop or dropdown menus)
4. Test with a sample call

Total time: 5-10 minutes. No coding required.

You might want to work with your bookkeeper to ensure field mapping matches your chart of accounts, but the technical setup is straightforward.

### What if the AI gets customer information wrong?

Modern AI phone systems achieve 85-95% accuracy for structured data like names, phone numbers, and service types. Here's how mistakes are prevented:

- **Clarifying questions:** If the AI isn't sure about a name spelling, it asks: "Can you spell your last name for me?"
- **Confirmation:** AI repeats information back: "I have your phone number as 555-123-4567, is that correct?"
- **Review before finalizing:** You can review and edit customer records in QuickBooks before creating final invoices
- **Fail-safe:** If the AI can't capture required info, it flags the record for manual follow-up

The most common "errors" aren't really errorsthey're ambiguous situations. Customer says "JC Plumbing" (business name) but AI captures it as first name "JC." You can fix this in QuickBooks in 10 seconds, which is still faster than manual entry.

### Can I customize which services map to which QuickBooks items?

Yes. Service item mapping is completely customizable during setup.

You define the rules:
- **Keyword matching:** "emergency" or "urgent" � "Emergency Service" item
- **Service type:** "water heater" � "Water Heater Service" item
- **Time-based:** Calls after 5 PM � "After-Hours Service" item
- **Complex logic:** "commercial" + "electrical panel" � "Commercial Electrical - Panel" item

You can have as many mappings as you need:
- Emergency plumbing vs. routine plumbing (different rates)
- Residential vs. commercial (different pricing tiers)
- Diagnostic vs. repair vs. installation (different service items)

Update mappings anytime without affecting past customer records or invoices.

### How much does QuickBooks integration cost?

**QuickBooks:**
- QuickBooks Online Simple Start: $30/month
- QuickBooks Online Essentials: $60/month
- QuickBooks Online Plus: $90/month
- QuickBooks Online Advanced: $200/month

**Integration costs vary:**
- **CRM integrations:** $15-100/month (Method CRM, HubSpot, Salesforce)
- **Phone systems:** $20-50/user/month (Ooma, RingCentral) - usually basic caller ID only
- **Traditional answering service:** $500-800/month for 100 calls (no QuickBooks integration, manual data entry required)

**NextPhone:**
- $199/month unlimited calls
- QuickBooks integration included
- AI phone answering included
- No per-user fees
- No overage charges

To match NextPhone's functionality with traditional tools:
- Answering service: $600/month
- CRM with QuickBooks integration: $50/month
- **Total: $650/month vs NextPhone $199/month**

### What happens if the sync fails or QuickBooks is down?

Modern integrations have built-in fail-safes:

**Retry logic:** If a sync fails (QuickBooks temporarily down), the system queues the request and retries automatically every 5 minutes for up to 24 hours

**Error notifications:** You receive an email or dashboard alert if sync fails multiple times

**Data preservation:** Call data is never lostit's stored in the phone system until sync succeeds

**Manual fallback:** If you need the customer record urgently, you can manually create it in QuickBooks from the phone system dashboard (copy-paste)

In practice, sync failures are rare. QuickBooks Online has 99.5%+ uptime. Most "failed syncs" are configuration issues (wrong API token, field mapping error) that get caught during initial setup.

### Will this work with my existing QuickBooks setup?

Yes. Integrations ADD data to QuickBooksthey don't replace or modify your existing setup.

**What stays the same:**
- Your chart of accounts
- Your existing customers and invoices
- Your service items and pricing
- Your historical financial data
- Your accountant's access

**What gets added:**
- New customers from phone calls (with tags to identify source)
- New estimates and invoices (using your existing service items)
- New transactions synced from connected apps

You can (and should) test in a QuickBooks Sandbox environment before connecting your live account. This lets you verify field mapping, test workflows, and ensure everything syncs correctly without affecting real data.

Most businesses are fully integrated and running within 1-2 days, including setup and testing.

## Turn Every Call Into a Billable Client

QuickBooks integration eliminates double data entry and captures revenue you're currently losing. For service businesses, the combination of AI phone answering + QuickBooks automation is powerful: answer every call, create customer records automatically, trigger invoice workflows, and get paid faster.

The businesses winning in 2025 aren't the ones with the biggest marketing budgets. They're the ones answering every call and converting inquiries to invoices in minutes instead of days.

Stop losing calls and revenue to manual processes. NextPhone answers every call, creates QuickBooks customers automatically, and triggers your invoicing workflowso you can focus on the work, not the admin.
