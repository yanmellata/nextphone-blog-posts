# OUTLINE: "LionDesk Real Estate CRM + NextPhone: Lead Capture Setup"

## 2.1 STRUCTURE PLANNING

**User Intent:** Commercial/Informational - Real estate agents researching how to capture leads from calls and sync to their CRM (LionDesk or alternatives)

**User Journey:**
1. Problem awareness: "I'm missing calls when showing properties, losing leads"
2. Understanding scale: "How much is this actually costing me?"
3. Solution exploration: "How does AI phone answering work for property inquiries?"
4. Integration mechanics: "Can this sync with my CRM (LionDesk or alternatives)?"
5. ROI evaluation: "Is this worth it for a solo agent?"
6. Decision: "How do I set this up?"

**Questions to Answer (in order):**
1. Why can't real estate agents answer calls during showings?
2. How many leads are agents actually missing?
3. What's the commission impact of missed calls?
4. What is LionDesk and why does it matter for this integration?
5. How does AI qualify property inquiries (what questions, how it routes)?
6. How does NextPhone integrate with LionDesk specifically?
7. What happens when LionDesk shuts down in Sept 2025?
8. What's the ROI for solo agents specifically?
9. How long does setup take?
10. Does AI sound professional enough for real estate?

**High-Level Section Flow:**
- Intro ’ Hook with showing scenario + missed call = lost commission
- Section 1 ’ The speed-to-lead crisis in real estate (problem + data)
- Section 2 ’ LionDesk context (what it is, who uses it, Sept 2025 sunset)
- Section 3 ’ How AI property qualification works (questions, routing, workflow)
- Section 4 ’ NextPhone + LionDesk integration (setup, CRM sync, migration-ready)
- Section 5 ’ ROI for solo agents (commission protection math)
- FAQ ’ Address objections (sounds robotic? complex questions? setup time?)
- Conclusion ’ Recap + hard CTA

## SECTION 6: ROI for Solo Real Estate Agents

**Purpose:** Show exact math proving 16.5x ROI for solo agents
**Word Count Target:** 200-250 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. The Commission Protection Math
2. Monthly Cost vs Annual Savings

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Cost breakdown: NextPhone $199/month = $2,388/year, Traditional receptionist $35K/year (not viable for solo agent), Missed call cost: $40,800-122,400/year (based on 40-50 calls/month scenario)
- ROI calculation: $40,800 saved ÷ $2,388 cost = 17x ROI (conservative), $122,400 saved ÷ $2,388 cost = 51x ROI (high end)
- Break-even: Need to capture just 0.3 additional deals per year to break even (1 deal = $8,500 commission covers 3.5 years)
- Compare to alternatives: Hiring part-time assistant: $20K/year, Traditional answering service: $500-800/month = $6K-9.6K/year (doesn't qualify leads or sync CRM)

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **NextPhone cost:** $199/month (from factbase)
- **Commission protection:** $40,800-122,400/year saved
- **ROI:** 17-51x depending on call volume

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Real scenario: "If you close just 5 deals per year at $8,500 commission, missing even 10% due to slow response costs you $4,250. NextPhone pays for itself by capturing one additional deal."

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: ROI comparison chart (cost vs savings)
