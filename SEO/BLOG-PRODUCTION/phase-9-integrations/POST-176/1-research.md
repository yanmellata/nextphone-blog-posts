**Common Topics (Must Cover):**
- What Discord integration is
- How webhooks work
- Basic setup process
- Notification capabilities
- Integration with other platforms

**Content Gaps (OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **No SMB/home services angle** - All competitors focus on enterprise, gaming, or developers. NONE address small business phone/call integration needs
2. **No real-world call data** - Nobody shows actual business impact with proprietary data
3. **No phone system integration** - All focus on software-to-Discord, nobody covers phone call ’ Discord notifications
4. **No community-driven business use cases** - Gaming clans and enterprise teams covered, but not modern community businesses (Discord servers for customers)
5. **No transparent pricing comparisons** - Nobody shows "this costs $X, saves you $Y"
6. **Missing role-based business workflows** - Technical role mentions covered, but not "alert support team vs sales team based on call type"

**Best Practices:**
- Avg word count: 1,800-2,400 words
- Common format: Tutorial/Guide with step-by-step
- Data usage: Mostly feature descriptions, no proprietary business data
- Technical detail: Medium to high (webhook URLs, API calls)

- "Our team lives in Discord. Getting CRM updates there would be huge but I don't see phone integration anywhere." - r/entrepreneur

## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- **74.1% missed calls** ’ Use in: Problem section (show why Discord alerts matter)
- **25.4% callbacks requested** ’ Use in: Benefits section (tracking callback requests via Discord)
- **15.9% urgency language** ’ Use in: Role-based alerts section (routing urgent calls to @support role)
- **6.2% true emergencies** ’ Use in: Use cases section (emergency call ’ Discord ping)
- **42 calls/month average** ’ Use in: ROI calculations
- **$260,400/year lost** ’ Use in: Why integration matters section

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls/month ’ Use in: Problem awareness section
2. Data shows despite skepticism, customers prefer capable AI over low-quality human answering services ’ Use in: Solution section

**Industry Examples:**
- **Plumbing (3 customers):** Under houses, can't answer phone. Emergency calls (pipe burst) need immediate team notification
- **HVAC (2 customers):** On ladders, can't reach phone. AC emergencies in 95° heat = high-value, time-sensitive
- **Roofing (6 customers):** On roofs installing shingles. Storm season spikes need overflow handling
- **General Contractors (19 customers - PRIMARY ICP):** On job sites, hands dirty. Miss estimate requests to faster competitors

**ROI Calculations:**
- **Typical contractor:** 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
- **Conversion opportunity:** 31 missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 project = $21,700/mo lost = **$260,400/year lost**
- **Emergency call economics:** 15.9% urgent = ~7 urgent calls/month. Missing 1 emergency/week = $16,800/mo lost = **$201,600/year lost**
- **NextPhone cost:** $199/mo = **$2,388/year**
- **ROI:** $260,400 saved ÷ $2,388 cost = **10,900% ROI**

**Integration Capabilities (from Factbase):**
- **HTTP Webhooks (Live):** Send structured data to ANY external system during/after calls
- **Custom parameters:** AI collects caller name, phone, email, call intent, urgency level, etc.
- **Template variables:** {{caller_number}}, {{receiving_number}}, {{message}}, {{owner_name}}, custom fields
- **Real-time execution:** During calls (AI can trigger while talking) and after calls (automatic notifications)
- **Fail-safe:** Integrations fail silently to never interrupt call experience

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services customers over 7 months..."
 "According to our study of 2,487 customer interactions, 25.4% explicitly requested callbacks..."

3. Why businesses use Discord (community engagement)
4. Role-based notification capabilities
5. Integration with other business tools

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

2. **Real Business Data**
   - Competitors: Generic examples, no proprietary data
   - We'll do: Lead with 13,175 call analysis, 74.1% missed, $260K/year lost

6. **Actual Setup Guide (Non-Technical)**

   - We'll do: Simple 5-step process any business owner can follow

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Focus on modern community-driven businesses (Discord servers with customers/members) who need phone call notifications in Discord. Lead with real call data (74.1% missed), show role-based alert workflows for different call types (emergency ’ @support, quote ’ @sales), and provide simple non-technical setup using NextPhone's HTTP webhook integration. Position as "your team lives in Discord; your customers should reach you there too."

**How We'll Beat #1 (Zapier's Discord Integration Page):**
1. **More specific use case** - Zapier is generic "connect 8,000 apps." We're "phone calls ’ Discord for community businesses"
