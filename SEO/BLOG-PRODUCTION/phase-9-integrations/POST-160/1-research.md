## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What Five9 is (cloud contact center platform)
2. Five9 integration options (CRM, API, UC)
3. Five9 pricing structure
4. Integration challenges/benefits
5. Alternative solutions

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**
1. **Reality Check on Costs** - Competitors: Vague pricing, We'll do: Show $5,950/month minimum makes Five9 enterprise-only
2. **SMB Alternative Positioning** - Competitors: Ignore SMB segment, We'll do: Show NextPhone as right-sized Five9 alternative
3. **Real Integration ROI** - Competitors: Feature lists, We'll do: Use proprietary call data to show actual business impact
4. **Honest Assessment** - Competitors: Either pro-Five9 or anti-Five9, We'll do: Balanced view (Five9 great for enterprises, overkill for SMBs)
5. **Speed to Value** - Competitors: Ignore setup time, We'll do: Show Five9 takes weeks/months, NextPhone takes hours
6. **Missed Call Problem First** - Competitors: Assume calls are answered, We'll do: Lead with 74.1% missed call reality
7. **Integration Without Complexity** - Competitors: Technical jargon, We'll do: Simple explanation of what integration actually means

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Five9 is a powerful enterprise contact center platform with deep integration capabilitiesbut with a $5,950/month minimum (50 users), it's built for large teams. For small businesses missing 74.1% of customer calls, the problem isn't needing a complex CCaaS platformit's answering the phone. NextPhone delivers the core capability small businesses need (AI call answering + CRM integration) at $199/month, getting you operational in hours instead of months."

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More honest about pricing** - Show exact Five9 costs including minimums, not vague "contact sales"
2. **More data-driven** - Lead with proprietary 13,175 call analysis showing real SMB pain points
3. **Better positioned** - Acknowledge Five9's strengths for enterprise, position NextPhone for SMB sweet spot
4. **More actionable** - Show specific use cases by business size/type
5. **Clearer ROI** - Show actual cost comparison with math ($71,400/year vs $2,388/year)
