You're on a roof installing shingles. Your phone rings. It's 2 PM on a Tuesdayprime time for customer calls. But your hands are full, you're 20 feet up, and there's no way you're answering. The call goes to voicemail. The customer needs a quote by end of day. They call the next roofer. You just lost a $4,500 job.

In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

The bigger problem? Most of these calls leave no trace in your project management system. They just disappear. You have no idea who called, what they needed, or how much revenue walked away.

What if every call automatically appeared in your Monday.com boardwith the caller's name, phone number, service request, and urgency level already filled in? What if your whole team could see every call, track every follow-up, and never let another lead slip through?

That's exactly what happens when you connect an AI receptionist to Monday.com.

## The $260,000 Problem Service Businesses Don't See

Most contractors don't track missed calls. There's no dashboard showing "31 calls went unanswered this month." The calls just... don't happen. From your perspective, the phone didn't ring.

But from the customer's perspective, they called and got voicemail. So they called your competitor.

### How Many Calls You're Actually Missing

We analyzed call data from 47 home services contractors over 7 months. The average contractor receives 42 calls per month. Of those 42 calls, 31 go completely unansweredthat's 74.1%.

[IMAGE: Bar chart showing 74.1% missed vs 25.9% answered calls]

Why so high? You're on job sites. Under houses. On ladders. In attics. Your hands are dirty, covered in paint or grout or drywall mud. You physically cannot answer your phone during most of your working day.

### The Revenue Impact (With Real Math)

Here's where it gets painful. Let's do the math for a typical general contractor:

- 42 calls per month
- 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls
- At a conservative 20% conversion rate, that's 6 jobs you didn't get
- At $3,500 average project value = $21,700 per month in lost revenue
- Annualized: **$260,400 per year**

For the cost of a decent used truck, you're losing a quarter million dollars annually.

And that's using conservative numbers. If you're in HVAC or electrical work, your average job value is higher. If you work in a competitive market, your conversion rate is lower because customers don't waitthey call the next person immediately.

### Why Missed Calls Hurt More Than You Think

According to our call analysis, 15.9% of calls contain urgency language: "emergency," "urgent," "ASAP," "right now." These emergency calls are worth morean average of $4,200 vs $3,500 for routine work.

Missing just one emergency call per week costs you $16,800 per month. That's $201,600 per year from emergency calls alone.

One plumber told us: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

Business wasn't slow. His phone was ringing. He just wasn't there to answer it.

## Monday.com: The Visual Work Operating System for Teams

If you're not familiar with Monday.com, here's what you need to know: it's a visual project management platform used by over 225,000 companies globally. In 2025, Monday.com's revenue surged to $299 million with 27% year-over-year growth.

### How Monday.com Works (Visual Boards)

Think of Monday.com as a digital whiteboard with superpowers. You create boards for different parts of your businessone for new leads, one for active jobs, one for quotes pending, etc.

Each board has items (like individual jobs or customers) displayed as rows. Columns show information about each item: client name, service type, status, priority, assigned team member, due date.

[IMAGE: Screenshot of Monday.com board showing contractor job tracking]

The magic is that everything is visual. You can see, at a glance, which jobs are "In Progress" (yellow), which are "Completed" (green), and which are "Stuck" (red). Your whole team sees the same board. Everyone knows what's happening.

### Why Service Businesses Choose Monday.com

Research shows that project management software can boost productivity by 50% and save up to 20% on project costs. For service businesses, Monday.com works because:

- **It's visual.** Your field team isn't reading spreadsheets. They look at the board and immediately understand what needs to happen.
- **It's flexible.** Customize boards for how YOU work, not how some software company thinks you should work.
- **It automates repetitive stuff.** When a job moves to "Completed," Monday can automatically send a follow-up email requesting a review.

### The Integration Ecosystem

Monday.com offers 200+ integrations with tools like Slack, Gmail, Google Drive, QuickBooks, and more. This lets you connect your entire business workflow in one place.

But here's the gap: Monday.com doesn't have native phone capabilities. You can't make calls from Monday. You can't automatically log incoming calls. There's no way to capture phone conversation details without manually typing them in.

That's where NextPhone integration comes in.

## How AI + Monday.com Creates Your Call Command Center

Here's how the integration works from the customer's perspective and yours:

### The AI Receptionist Layer

When a customer calls your business number, NextPhone's AI receptionist answers in under 5 seconds. Not after 30+ seconds of ringing like traditional answering servicesunder 5 seconds.

The AI knows your business. It's trained on your services, pricing, availability, and common customer questions. It sounds professional and helpful.

During the conversation, the AI collects structured information:

- Caller's name and phone number
- What service they need
- Address or location
- Description of the issue or project
- Timeline (urgent, this week, next month)
- How they heard about you

The customer has a helpful conversation. They feel heard. They get their questions answered.

### HTTP Webhook Integration (No Coding Required)

While the AI is talking to the customer, here's what's happening behind the scenes:

All that structured data gets packaged up and sent to Monday.com via an HTTP webhook. Think of a webhook as a direct pipeline from the phone call into your Monday board.

You don't need to know how to code. You don't need to be technical. During setup, you simply map the data fields:

- `{{caller_number}}` goes to your "Phone" column
- `{{message}}` goes to your "Notes" column
- Urgency level goes to your "Priority" column
- Service type goes to your "Service" column

[IMAGE: Workflow diagram showing: Phone call ’ AI conversation ’ Data extraction ’ HTTP webhook ’ Monday.com board ’ Team notification]

The webhook runs in the background. If something goes wrong (Monday.com is down, internet hiccup), the integration fails silently. The call continues normally. The customer never knows there's an integration happening.

### What Data Gets Captured

You control what the AI asks and what data gets sent to Monday. Common fields for service businesses:

- **Contact info:** Name, phone (clickable to call back), email if provided
- **Service type:** Plumbing, electrical, HVAC, roofing, etc.
- **Job description:** "Kitchen sink is leaking under the cabinet"
- **Address:** Where the work needs to happen
- **Urgency:** Emergency, urgent, routine, planning ahead
- **Budget/timeline:** "Need it done this week" or "Getting quotes for spring"
- **Source:** How they found you (Google, referral, Facebook ad)

The AI can collect any information you define. There's no limit to custom fields.

### Where It Goes in Monday.com

When the call ends, a new item appears in your Monday board. Let's say you have a "New Leads" board for incoming quote requests.

The item shows up with all columns populated:

| Name | Phone | Service | Status | Priority | Address | Notes | Source |
|------|-------|---------|--------|----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Sarah Johnson | (555) 123-4567 | Roofing | New Lead | High | 123 Oak St | Shingles damaged after storm | Google |

Your team sees it immediately. If you have automations set up, Monday can trigger notifications:

- Send Slack message to project manager: "New roofing lead from Sarah Johnson"
- Send email to estimator: "High-priority quote request ready"
- Auto-assign to team member based on service type

The call that would have gone to voicemail is now a trackable, visible, actionable item in your workflow.

## Real-World Workflows: From Missed Calls to Managed Jobs

Here's where this gets powerful. You can create custom workflows for different types of calls.

### Emergency Call Routing + Priority Item Creation

The AI detects urgency keywords: "emergency," "burst pipe," "no power," "AC out," "urgent."

When detected:

1. AI immediately transfers the call to your cell phone (live handoff during the call)
2. Simultaneously creates a high-priority item in Monday with status "Emergency"
3. Monday automation sends urgent notifications to your team (Slack, SMS, email)
4. Item is color-coded red so it's visually obvious

Example: It's 2 AM. A customer's pipe bursts. They call your business line. The AI recognizes "emergency" and "burst pipe," answers the call, and transfers to your emergency phone. While you're talking to the customer, a red emergency item appears in your Monday board with all the details. When your crew arrives at 8 AM, they see the job, the address, and the customer's phone number.

You didn't lose sleep (call came to AI first), the customer got immediate help (transferred to you), and your team has full context (Monday board).

### Callback Request Tracking (Never Drop a Lead)

In our analysis of 2,487 calls, we found that 25.4% of callers explicitly requested a callback: "Can someone call me back?" or "Have them give me a quote when they get a chance."

Without a tracking system, 80% of those callback requests get forgotten. That's $113,400 per year in lost revenue from callbacks that never happened.

With Monday.com integration:

1. AI logs the callback request
2. Creates Monday item with status "Callback Needed"
3. Sets due date based on urgency (today, tomorrow, this week)
4. Monday automation sends reminder if callback isn't completed within 24 hours

Your office manager or project manager sees a clear list of "Callback Needed" items. They make the calls. Nothing falls through the cracks.

### New Lead Qualification and Assignment

Not all leads are equal. The AI can ask qualifying questions:

- "What's your budget for this project?"
- "What's your timeline?"
- "Is this for a home or commercial property?"

Based on the answers, the Monday item gets tagged and assigned appropriately:

- High-budget residential leads ’ assigned to your senior estimator
- Commercial inquiries ’ assigned to commercial team
- Small repair jobs ’ assigned to maintenance crew
- Out-of-budget or out-of-area ’ marked "Not Qualified" for future marketing analysis

Your sales team spends time on qualified leads, not every single call that comes in.

### After-Hours Call Logging

According to industry data, 73% of calls to home services businesses happen outside standard 9-5 hours. People call when they notice the problem: Saturday morning when they're doing yard work, Sunday evening when they're planning the week, 9 PM when the AC stops working.

With the AI + Monday.com integration:

- Calls at 9 PM don't wake you up
- AI answers professionally, captures all information
- Creates Monday item for follow-up first thing next business day
- Customer feels heard and helped (not ignored)
- You get a good night's sleep

[IMAGE: Monday.com board showing different call statuses: Emergency (red), Callback Needed (orange), New Lead (blue), In Progress (yellow), Completed (green)]

When you open Monday on Monday morning, you see every after-hours call that came in over the weekend, with full context and next steps ready.

## Why Service Teams Love Monday.com + NextPhone

### Never Miss Another Call (24/7 Coverage)

AI never sleeps. Never takes vacation. Never calls in sick. It answers every call in under 5 seconds, 365 days a year.

Compare costs:

- **Full-time receptionist:** $35,000/year (and only works 9-5 Monday-Friday)
- **Traditional answering service:** $500-800/month with per-call charges after 100 calls
- **NextPhone:** $199/month, unlimited calls, all features included

You save 93% compared to hiring a receptionist, and you get 24/7 coverage that a human can't provide.

### Visual Tracking Everyone Understands

Monday.com's strength is visual boards. You don't need training to understand "green means done, red means urgent."

Your field techs can open the Monday mobile app while sitting in their truck and see:

- Which job is next
- Customer's phone number (tap to call)
- Service requested
- Special notes ("Customer has a big dog, call before entering yard")

Non-technical team members get it immediately. No complicated software to learn.

### Team Collaboration Without Tool Switching

All the call context lives in Monday alongside job details, photos, invoices, and team comments. When a tech finishes a job and the customer says "Oh, by the way, I also need electrical work," the tech can @mention your electrician right there in Monday.

Full history is visible:

- When the customer first called
- What they originally requested
- What you quoted
- What you actually did
- Follow-up tasks

No more "he said, she said." Everything is documented automatically.

### Automation Eliminates Manual Data Entry

Research shows that business process automation helps project managers reclaim roughly 20% of their daily time. BPM projects can reduce operational errors by more than 70%.

Think about your current process:

1. Customer calls
2. You talk to them (if you even answer)
3. You jot notes on paper or in your phone
4. Later, you manually enter those notes into your system
5. You assign the job to someone
6. You set a reminder to follow up

That's 10+ minutes of admin work per call. For 42 calls per month, that's 7 hours of manual data entry.

With Monday.com + NextPhone, all of that happens automatically. You go straight from "call received" to "job assigned and tracked." Zero manual work.

According to McKinsey, AI could boost productivity across sectors by up to 40%. For service businesses drowning in administrative work, that productivity gain is a lifeline.

| Traditional Phone System | NextPhone + Monday.com |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| Miss 74.1% of calls | Answer 100% of calls with AI |
| Manual call logging (10 min/call) | Automatic data capture |
| No visibility for team | Visual boards everyone sees |
| Forgotten callbacks | Automated follow-up tracking |
| $35K/year receptionist (9-5 only) | $199/month (24/7 coverage) |
| No emergency detection | Auto-route urgent calls to owner |

## Getting Started: Setup in Under 30 Minutes

You don't need to be technical. You don't need a developer. The setup process is template-based.

### Step 1: Configure Your AI Receptionist

In the NextPhone dashboard, you train your AI on your business:

- What services do you offer? (Plumbing, HVAC, electrical, etc.)
- What are your hours?
- What are common customer questions and answers?
- How should the AI handle different call types?

This takes about 10 minutes. You can also upload your website URL and NextPhone's AI will automatically extract your business information.

### Step 2: Set Up HTTP Webhook

You'll create an HTTP webhook connection to Monday.com's API. NextPhone provides a template. You'll need:

- Your Monday.com API key (generated in Monday settings, takes 30 seconds)
- Which board you want calls to go to
- The board ID (visible in Monday URL)

Paste those into the webhook setup form. Done.

### Step 3: Map Data to Monday.com Board

This is where you define what goes where. It's like filling out a simple form:

- When AI asks "What's your name?" ’ Send to Monday column "Name"
- When AI asks "What service do you need?" ’ Send to Monday column "Service Type"
- When AI detects urgency ’ Set Monday column "Priority" to "High"

You can map as many or as few fields as you want. Use template variables like `{{caller_number}}`, `{{message}}`, `{{owner_name}}`, or create custom fields.

### Step 4: Test and Go Live

Make a test call to your NextPhone number. Say you need a quote for roofing. Check Monday.comdoes the item appear? Are the columns filled in correctly?

If yes, you're live. If something needs adjustment, tweak the mapping and test again.

[IMAGE: Four-step setup diagram with checkmarks]

NextPhone support is available during setup if you get stuck. Most customers go live in under 30 minutes.

## What Does It Cost?

### NextPhone Pricing

**$199 per month** for unlimited calls. No per-minute charges, no per-call fees, no overage costs. All features included:

- AI receptionist (answers 24/7)
- Unlimited calls
- Call recording and transcripts
- HTTP webhook integrations (including Monday.com)
- SMS follow-ups
- Email notifications
- Call transfer to your phone
- Spam call filtering (7% of calls in our data were spamAI blocks them automatically)

### Monday.com Plan Requirements

Monday.com has several pricing tiers. For the integration to work, you need at least the **Standard plan** ($10 per seat/month) because it includes integration actions.

- **Basic plan** ($8/seat/month): 250 integration actions/month
- **Standard plan** ($10/seat/month): 250 actions/month (recommended minimum)
- **Pro plan** ($16/seat/month): 25,000 actions/month

Most small service businesses (3-5 team members) fit comfortably in the Standard plan. If you're processing hundreds of calls per month, you might need Pro.

### Total Cost of Ownership vs Alternatives

Let's say you have a 3-person team:

- **Monday.com Standard:** $30/month (3 seats × $10)
- **NextPhone:** $199/month
- **Total:** $229/month

Compare that to:

- **Traditional answering service:** $500-800/month (for just 100-150 calls, with overage fees)
- **Full-time receptionist:** $2,900/month ($35,000/year average salary)

You're paying $229 vs $500-2,900 for better service (AI never sleeps, never makes mistakes, integrates directly with your workflow).

And remember: you're saving $260,400/year in lost revenue from missed calls. The integration pays for itself in the first week.

**14-day free trial available** for NextPhone. No credit card required. Test the Monday.com integration with real calls before committing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use my existing business phone number?

Yes. You can forward your existing business number to NextPhone. This works with any carrierAT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, or any other provider. Your customers keep calling the same number they've always used. You don't need to print new business cards or update your website.

### Does this work with Monday.com's mobile app?

Absolutely. All call data syncs to Monday.com's mobile app in real time. Your field teams can see updates while they're on job sites, update item statuses from their phones, and get push notifications when new calls come in. The mobile experience is just as smooth as the desktop version.

### What if the AI can't answer a question?

The AI is trained on your specific businessyour services, pricing, hours, and common customer questions. For routine inquiries, it handles everything. For complex or unusual questions, the AI can transfer the call to your phone mid-conversation. You get a seamless handoff with full context. It's a hybrid approach: AI handles the routine, you handle the complex.

### Can I create different workflows for different call types?

Yes. HTTP webhooks are fully customizable. You can route emergency calls to a different Monday board than quote requests. You can have one board for residential leads and another for commercial inquiries. You can trigger different automations based on service type, time of day, or any other criteria. The workflow possibilities are unlimited.

### How secure is the integration?

API keys are encrypted both in transit and at rest. All webhook calls use HTTPS only. Monday.com's enterprise-grade security standards apply to all data. HIPAA-compliant call handling is available if your business requires it. Your customer data is protected at every step.

### What happens if Monday.com is down?

If Monday.com experiences an outage, your AI receptionist continues answering calls normally. The integration fails silently in the backgroundthe call quality and customer experience are never interrupted. When Monday.com comes back online, the queued data syncs automatically. You never lose a customer call due to integration issues.

## Stop Missing Calls, Start Managing Them Visually

Service businesses lose an average of $260,400 per year from missed callscalls that simply disappear because there's no system to capture them. When you connect NextPhone's AI receptionist to Monday.com, every call becomes visible, trackable, and actionable.

Your competitors are answering the calls you're missing. Monday.com's visual boards make complex call management simple enough that your entire teamfrom field techs to office staffcan see what's happening and take action.

Setup takes minutes. The impact is immediate. And with a 14-day free trial, you can test the integration with real customer calls before making a decision.
