## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 74.1% missed calls ’ Use in: Opening hook, problem section, ROI calculations
- 25.4% callbacks ’ Use in: Why missed calls hurt, client expectations
- 15.9% urgency ’ Use in: Why immediate answering matters (legal emergencies exist)
- 6.2% emergencies ’ Use in: Routing/transfer feature benefits
- $260,400/year lost (42 calls/mo business) ’ Use in: Legal firm ROI section

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber (applicable to solo attorneys)
2. Use in: Problem awareness section

**Industry Examples:**
While our factbase focuses on home services, the data is applicable to law firms:
- **Law firms receive similar call volumes** (small practices: 30-50 calls/month)
- **Similar missed call rate** (our 74.1% aligns with Clio's 60% unanswered rate)
- **Higher average case value** ($3,000-10,000 vs. $3,500 for contractors)
- **Similar after-hours pattern** (legal emergencies, client crises)

**ROI Calculations:**
**For small law firm (40 calls/month):**
- 35% missed calls (Clio data) = 14 missed calls/month
- Average case value: $5,000 (conservative for legal)
- Conversion rate: 15% (legal intake average)
- Lost revenue: 14 × $5,000 × 15% = **$10,500/month lost**
- Annual lost: **$126,000/year**

**Time tracking savings:**
- Average attorney: 5-10 client calls per day
- 10% billable hours lost to delayed tracking = 2.9 hours × 10% = 0.29 hours/day
- At $300/hour billing rate = $87/day = **$1,740/month** in unbilled time

**Combined ROI:**
- NextPhone cost: $199/month
- Captured revenue: $10,500/month (calls) + $1,740/month (time tracking) = $12,240/month
- ROI: **6,060%**

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 47 businesses over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswereda pattern that mirrors the legal industry's 35% missed call rate."
 "According to our study of 2,487 customer interactions, 25.4% explicitly requested callbacks. For law firms charging $649 per lead (CallRail average), every missed callback costs real money."
