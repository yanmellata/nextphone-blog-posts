---

### INTRODUCTION

**Purpose:** Hook readers with the problem and promise the solution
**Word Count Target:** 120-150 words

**Key Points to Cover:**

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Average PI case settles for $5,000-$8,000

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Calculation:** "80 calls/month × 35% missed = 28 missed calls"
- **Calculation:** "28 missed calls × 15% conversion × $6,500 avg case = $27,300/month lost"
- **Calculation:** "Annual impact: $327,600 in lost revenue"
- **NextPhone stat:** "Our analysis of 13,175 calls showed 74.1% go unanswered (worse than law firm average) - if your firm mirrors this, losses could exceed $57,000/month"

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Mid-sized PI firm (3 attorneys) losing $400K+/year to missed calls
