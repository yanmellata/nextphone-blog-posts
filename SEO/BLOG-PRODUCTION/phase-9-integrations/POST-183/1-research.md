## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

**Key User Concerns (from search analysis):**

**Speed of Follow-Up:**
- Users want to contact leads within minutes of form submission
- 80% of sales leads require 5+ follow-ups after initial contact
- Fast responses show value and attentiveness
- Ideal response time: Within 1 hour of inquiry

**Multi-Channel Follow-Up:**
- Email + phone calls result in higher response rates than either alone
- First response should match the lead's preferred contact method
- Texting after initial contact results in 112% higher engagement
- Typical conversion requires 7-10 touches

**Typeform Limitations:**
- Can't pre-fill form fields or access returning responder data
- One question per page can be limiting
- Limited conditional logic for complex forms
- No built-in phone call automation
- Response limits can shut down forms at 100% capacity
- Lacks advanced A/B testing

**Integration Challenges:**
- Users bypass Typeform calculations and use Google Sheets for scoring
- Open text responses harder to automate than multiple choice
- Complex logic rules difficult to manage across 100+ questions
- Limited CSS/font customization for branding

**Real User Pain Points:**
- "How do I trigger a phone call when someone submits my Typeform?"
- "Can I route emergency form submissions to my phone immediately?"
- "How do I avoid losing leads who fill out forms after hours?"
- "What's the best way to qualify leads before calling them?"
- "How can I automate follow-up without hiring staff?"
