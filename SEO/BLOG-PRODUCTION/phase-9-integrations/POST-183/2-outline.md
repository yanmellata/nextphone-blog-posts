## KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-the-fold summary for scanners
**Word Count Target:** 60-80 words (6 bullets)

- Typeform webhooks can trigger instant phone calls via NextPhone AI receptionist
- Forms qualify leads (urgency, service type), AI calls within 60 seconds, routes emergencies to owner
- Setup costs $199/mo (NextPhone) + Typeform free tier vs. $260K/year in missed leads

---

- Fills out website Typeform with details
- Gets generic "Thanks, we'll contact you soon" message
- Calls competitor who answers immediately, books job
- Your business loses $4,200 because form sat in inbox until Monday

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- Emergency jobs average $4,200 (higher than routine work) - Source: NextPhone factbase
- 74.1% of calls go unanswered - Source: NextPhone 13,175-call analysis

**Examples/Quotes:**

**Visual Needed:**
- None (intro section, keep text-focused)

**Links to Add:**

**Transition:** "Here's the thing most businesses miss: collecting form data is only half the battle. The real revenue comes from what happens next."

## SECTION 1: The Form Follow-Up Gap

**Purpose:** Establish the problem - forms collect data but don't complete the sale
**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Forms Capture Intent, Not Sales
2. The Speed-to-Lead Problem
3. Multi-Touch Reality

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Forms are great for capturing contact info and qualifying interest
- But data collection ` closed deal
- Speed matters: ideal response time is within 1 hour
- Most businesses check form submissions during business hours only
- After-hours forms sit until Monday morning
- By then, prospect has called 3 other contractors
- Conversion requires 7-10 touches across multiple channels

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "Contact leads within an hour of inquiry for best results" - Source: DemandZEN
- **Stat 2:** "80% of sales leads require 5 follow-ups after initial contact, but only 8% of salespeople follow up this many times" - Source: Podium
- **Stat 3:** "Email + phone calls result in higher response rates than either alone" - Source: DemandZEN
- **Stat 4:** "Typical conversion requires 7-10 touches" - Source: Podium

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Plumber gets form at 8 PM Friday, checks Monday at 9 AM (36+ hour delay)
- Example: Real estate agent - first to respond gets the showing, speed = competitive advantage

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Chart showing response time vs. conversion rate
- Placement: After "Speed-to-Lead Problem" subsection
- Alt text: "Chart showing lead conversion decreases dramatically after first hour"

## SECTION 3: How Typeform Webhooks Work

**Purpose:** Explain technical foundation (webhooks) in simple terms
**Word Count Target:** 180-220 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. What Is a Webhook?
2. Typeform's Webhook Capability

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Technical detail:** "HTTP POST request with JSON response data" - Source: Typeform webhook docs

**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. CRM Sync (HubSpot, Salesforce)

- Zapier/Make: Connect to 1,000+ apps without coding
- **But**: All these stop at data transfer

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "Automatically send thank-you emails, add users to CRM, document answers" - Source: Zapier
- **Stat 2:** "Texting after initial contact results in 112% higher engagement" - Source: Podium
