## SECTION 0: KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-the-fold summary for scanners
**Word Count Target:** 50-75 words (4-5 bullets)

**Bullets:**
- Every customer call automatically creates a Trello card with caller details, AI summary, and urgency level
- Visual boards let your team see the entire call pipeline from new lead to completed job
- In our analysis of 13,175 calls, 74.1% went unanswered - Trello integration ensures nothing falls through the cracks
- Emergency calls get labeled and prioritized automatically so urgent work moves to the top of your board
- NextPhone's AI receptionist connects to Trello via webhooks - setup takes minutes, not hours

**Word Count Target:** 100-120 words

**Key Points to Cover:**
- You already use Trello - it's visual, simple, your team actually uses it
- But calls don't automatically appear there - manual entry fails
- Result: Missed opportunities vanish into voicemail
- Lead with 74.1% missed call stat
- Promise: Automatic call-to-card creation solves this
