3. **No specific workflow examples** - Lack of "contractor gets call ’ card appears in pipeline" scenarios
4. **No pricing transparency** - Nobody discusses actual costs or cost savings

## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- **74.1% missed calls** ’ Use in: Opening hook - "Three out of every four calls go unanswered"
- **25.4% callbacks requested** ’ Use in: Follow-up section - "One in four callers explicitly asks for callbacks"
- **15.9% urgency language** ’ Use in: Prioritization section - "Nearly 16% of calls contain urgent keywords"
- **6.2% true emergencies** ’ Use in: Emergency routing section

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls in one month ’ Use in: Problem section
2. [Use additional quotes as needed from factbase]

**Industry Examples:**
- **General Contractors (19 customers):** Average 42 calls/month, 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
- **Trades (Electrical, Plumbing, HVAC):** Emergency calls average $4,200 - higher than routine work
- **Home Services:** Can't answer phone while on job site (on ladder, hands dirty, etc.)

**ROI Calculations:**
- **42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 = $21,700/month lost**
- **Missing 1 emergency call/week = $16,800/month lost**
- **NextPhone cost: $199/mo ’ ROI: 10,900% (if capturing just 10% of missed calls)**

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months..."
 "We found that 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered (9,766 out of 13,175 calls)"

## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What Trello integration means
2. How to connect phone systems to Trello
3. Benefits of visual workflow management
4. Basic setup steps
5. Use cases for call tracking

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

1. **Real Call Data**
   - Competitors: Generic claims about "missed calls cost money"
   - We'll do: Show actual data from 13,175 calls - 74.1% missed, specific revenue impact

2. **SMB Home Services Focus**
   - Competitors: Generic "businesses" or "customer service teams"
   - We'll do: Target contractors, trades, service businesses with specific scenarios (on roof, under sink, can't answer)

3. **Transparent Pricing & ROI**
   - Competitors: No pricing discussion or vague "contact us"
   - We'll do: Show NextPhone $199/mo, calculate actual ROI with real numbers

4. **Emergency Call Handling**
   - Competitors: Treat all calls the same
   - We'll do: Show how urgent calls get labeled/prioritized differently in Trello

5. **Complete Workflow Example**
   - Competitors: "Create a card from a call" (surface level)
   - We'll do: Walk through entire flow - call ’ AI collection ’ data mapping ’ card appears with all details ’ team action

6. **Visual Pipeline Management**
   - Competitors: Focus on individual cards
   - We'll do: Show how calls flow through pipeline stages (New Lead ’ Contacted ’ Quoted ’ Scheduled ’ Completed)

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Lead with real call data (13,175 calls, 74.1% missed) and focus on visual board users in home services who want every call to automatically appear as a trackable card in their existing Trello workflow. Show complete automation flow with transparent pricing ($199/mo) and specific ROI calculations. Position as 'your visual workflow already works - just plug in AI answering to feed it.'"

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More data-driven:** Proprietary 13,175-call dataset vs. generic industry claims
2. **More specific:** Home services/trades examples vs. generic "businesses"
3. **More transparent:** Show actual pricing and ROI math vs. vague benefits
4. **Better workflow detail:** Complete call-to-card flow with visual pipeline stages
5. **Unique feature:** Emergency detection + automatic card labeling/prioritization
