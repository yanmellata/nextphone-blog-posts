## KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-fold summary for scanners
**Word Count Target:** 60-80 words (4-5 bullets)

**Bullets:**
- Typical contractor loses $7,000/month from missed Yelp calls (74.1% go unanswered)
- Yelp's call tracking shows who called but doesn't answer or route intelligently
- New AI solutions (Yelp Receptionist $99/mo) answer but don't integrate with your CRM or filter spam
- Review sentiment matters: angry callers (from 1-star review) need different routing than excited callers (from 5-stars)
- NextPhone tracks source, understands context, answers 24/7, and syncs everything to your CRM for $199/month

---

## SECTION 1: The Yelp Call Attribution Problem

**H2 Title:** The Yelp Call Attribution Problem: Tracking What You Can't Capture

**Purpose:** Establish the core problem - businesses invest in Yelp but can't track or capture calls effectively

**Word Count Target:** 200-250 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Why Yelp Calls Are Hard to Track
2. The Cost of Missing Review-Driven Calls

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Yelp is a major lead source for local businesses (searchers read reviews, then call)
- Attribution problem: "Did this call come from Yelp, Google, or a referral?"
- Availability problem: 74.1% of calls go unanswered when you're on job sites
- Yelp searchers expect instant answers (competitive market)
- Review context lost: you don't know if caller saw 5-star or 1-star review

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "74.1% of customer calls go completely unanswered" - Source: NextPhone factbase (13,175 calls, 45 contractors, 7 months)
- **Stat 2:** "Typical contractor gets 42 calls/month, ~30% from Yelp = 13 Yelp calls, 10 go to voicemail" - Source: Calculated from factbase
- **Stat 3:** "$7,000/month lost from missed Yelp calls alone (10 missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 avg job)" - Source: NextPhone ROI calculation

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Scenario: "Customer sees your 4.8-star Yelp rating at 8 PM while researching plumbers for burst pipe emergency. Calls. Goes to voicemail. Calls next contractor. You lost a $4,200 emergency job."
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Bar chart showing "Sources of Customer Calls" (Yelp 30%, Google 40%, Direct 20%, Referral 10%) with miss rates
- Placement: After first paragraph
- Alt text: "Chart showing 30% of contractor calls come from Yelp with 74.1% miss rate"

**Links to Add:**
- **Internal:** Link to [missed calls statistics] with anchor text "three out of four calls go unanswered" - Context: When citing 74.1% stat
- **External:** Link to Sitejabber Yelp reviews with anchor text "business owners report attribution problems" - Context: When discussing pain points

## SECTION 2: How Yelp Call Tracking Works (And Its Limitations)

**H2 Title:** How Yelp Call Tracking Works (And Why It's Not Enough)

**Purpose:** Explain Yelp's native tracking + third-party options, then reveal limitations

**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Yelp's Free Call Reporting
2. Third-Party Call Tracking (CallRail)
3. What Tracking Doesn't Solve

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Yelp offers free call reporting to advertisers (phone masking/forwarding)
- Tracks: date, time, duration, partial number
- CallRail alternative: use your own tracking number, see full caller data
- Limitation 1: Tracking ` answering (you still miss the call)
- Limitation 2: No context (don't know caller sentiment, urgency, or review trigger)
- Limitation 3: No CRM sync (data lives in Yelp dashboard, not your system)

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "Yelp offers free call reporting to advertisers - track time and duration of calls" - Source: Yelp Support Center
- **Stat 2:** "Yelp for Business Owners has 1.3 stars from 653 reviews on Sitejabber" - Source: Sitejabber (pain point validation)

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Reddit quote: "I get tons of calls from my Yelp listing but have no idea which ones actually came from there vs Google" - r/smallbusiness
- Reddit quote: "Yelp's call tracking is garbage. They mask the number so I can't even call customers back" - r/entrepreneur

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Simple flowchart "Yelp Call Tracking Flow" - Customer sees listing ’ Calls masked number ’ Call forwards ’ You (might) answer ’ Data logged in Yelp dashboard
- Placement: After explaining how tracking works

## SECTION 3: After-Hours Calls, Spam, and the AI Answering Gap

**H2 Title:** The Gaps: After-Hours Calls, Spam Filtering, and Integration

**Purpose:** Highlight what tracking misses (timing, spam, answering, integration) and introduce Yelp's AI solutions

**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. When Yelp Calls Actually Happen (After Hours)
2. The Spam Problem Nobody Talks About
3. Yelp's AI Answering Services (Host & Receptionist)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Yelp searchers browse evenings/weekends (after business hours)
- 73% of calls happen outside 9-5 (factbase stat about after-hours)
- 7% of calls are spam (competitors calling, sales pitches, robocalls)
- Yelp Receptionist ($99/mo) and Host ($149/mo for restaurants) answer calls
- Limitation: Yelp AI is closed ecosystem (doesn't integrate with your CRM, limited customization)

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "73% of calls to home services businesses happen outside standard 9-5 hours" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Stat 2:** "7.0% of calls are spam/robocalls" - Source: NextPhone factbase (13,175 calls analyzed)
- **Stat 3:** "Yelp Receptionist starts at $99/month for local businesses, $149/month for Yelp Host (restaurants)" - Source: Yelp official blog

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Forum quote: "Most of my Yelp calls come at 7-9 PM when I'm off work" - Business owner forum
- Scenario: "Emergency HVAC search at 8 PM (AC died in 95° heat), customer searches Yelp reviews, calls top-rated contractor - goes to voicemail"

**Visual Needed:**

## SECTION 4: Review Sentiment + Call Routing: The Missing Link

**H2 Title:** Review Sentiment + Call Routing: Understanding Context Before You Answer

**Purpose:** Introduce unique angle - using review sentiment to inform call routing (main differentiator)

**Word Count Target:** 250-300 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Why Caller Sentiment Matters
2. How AI Detects Review Context
3. Smart Routing Based on Sentiment

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Caller saw reviews before calling - their sentiment is influenced by what they read
- Angry caller (responding to 1-star review) needs different handling than excited caller (saw 5-stars)
- 15.9% of calls contain urgency language ("emergency," "urgent," "ASAP")
- AI can detect: tone, urgency, keywords related to reviews
- Smart routing: escalate angry/urgent to owner, handle routine through AI, capture all context

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "15.9% of calls contain urgency language" - Source: NextPhone factbase (395 out of 2,487 calls analyzed)
- **Stat 2:** "AI and NLP can detect positive, negative, or neutral emotion by transcribing and analyzing every customer-agent conversation" - Source: Sentisum research
- **Stat 3:** "6.2% are true emergencies" - Source: NextPhone factbase (154 calls: pipe burst, no power, AC out)

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Forum quote: "Customer left 1-star review, then called. I answered not knowing they were angry. Would've prepared differently if I knew." - Local Search Forum
- Scenario: "Customer calls after reading 5-star review praising your emergency response. AI detects positive sentiment, asks qualifying questions, books appointment. Customer calls after 1-star review complaining about pricing. AI detects frustration, routes immediately to owner for resolution."

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Flowchart "Sentiment-Based Call Routing" - Customer sees review ’ Calls ’ AI analyzes tone/keywords ’ Routes based on sentiment (Positive ’ AI books appointment | Negative ’ Route to owner | Urgent ’ Immediate transfer)
- Placement: After explaining how sentiment detection works
- Alt text: "Flowchart showing AI routing calls based on review sentiment and urgency"

**Links to Add:**
