# Vonage Business + NextPhone: VoIP Integration & Migration Guide

**Meta Title:** Vonage AI Receptionist Integration: Add 24/7 Call Coverage 2025

**Meta Description:** Vonage VoIP doesn't answer calls—74.1% still go unanswered. Add AI receptionist or migrate completely. Three paths, 129X ROI, zero downtime.

**Key Takeaways:**

- VoIP alone doesn't solve missed callsin our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 businesses, 74.1% went completely unanswered even with systems like Vonage
- Vonage Business offers 40+ features and robust CRM integrations, but real pricing runs $26-30/user/month with fees, not the advertised $13.99
- You can integrate AI receptionist with existing Vonage via SIP, use NextPhone's unlimited webhook system, or migrate completely
- Three clear paths: (1) Add AI to Vonage for after-hours coverage, (2) Hybrid approach using both platforms, or (3) Migrate to AI-first platform
- Porting from Vonage takes 10-15 days with zero downtime when done correctly
- NextPhone captures missed calls 24/7 at $199/monthcapturing $260,400 in annual lost revenue for typical contractors (129X ROI)

---

You're on a ladder replacing an HVAC unit. It's 9 PM on a Tuesday. Your phone ringsit's a customer whose AC died in 95-degree heat. You can't answer. The call goes to voicemail. They call the next contractor. You just lost a $3,500 job.

This scenario plays out thousands of times daily. We analyzed 13,175 customer service calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months. The data is brutal: 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

Here's the paradox: most of these businesses already had VoIP phone systems like Vonage. They had call forwarding. Voicemail-to-email. Mobile apps. All the features. But features don't answer calls. People do. Or in 2025, AI does.

If you're using Vonage Business Communicationsor considering itthis guide shows you three actionable paths: add AI to your existing setup, use a hybrid approach, or migrate to an AI-first platform. No vendor bias. Just data-driven guidance for small businesses.

## The VoIP Paradox: Why Phone Systems Don't Answer Calls

### VoIP Gives You Features, Not Coverage

Vonage Business Communications is a solid unified communications platform. So is RingCentral. And 8x8. They offer call forwarding, simultaneous ring, mobile apps, voicemail transcription, team messaging, video conferencingthe works.

But here's what they don't offer: someone (or something) to actually pick up the phone.

You're a solo contractor installing a roof. Your phone rings. Call forwarding is set to your mobile. You're 30 feet up, hands full of shingles, can't reach your pocket. The call goes to voicemail. Vonage did its jobit forwarded the call perfectly. But nobody answered.

### The 74.1% Problem

In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. These weren't spam callswe filtered those out (7.0% of total volume). These were real customers looking for estimates, emergency repairs, and appointment bookings.

Breaking down those unanswered calls:

- 25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks (632 out of 2,487 analyzed)
- 15.9% contained urgency language like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP" (395 calls)
- 6.2% were true emergencies requiring same-day service (154 calls)

For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, missing 74.1% means 31 lost opportunities. If just 20% would have converted at an average $3,500 project value, that's $21,700 per month in lost revenueor $260,400 per year.

### Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short

VoIP features help you manage calls once they're answered. Call queues route calls to available team members. Auto-attendants play menu options. Follow-me routing tries multiple numbers in sequence.

But all of these require the same thing: someone available to pick up. If you're a one-person operation, or a small team where everyone's working on job sites during the day, these features don't solve your core problem.

As one plumber in our study put it: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

The missing piece isn't better call routing. It's intelligent, 24/7 call answering that actually picks up.

## What is Vonage Business Communications?

### Cloud-Based Unified Communications Platform

Vonage Business Communications (VBC) is a cloud-based phone system that combines voice calling, video conferencing, team messaging, and collaboration tools into a single platform. You don't need traditional phone lines or PBX hardwareeverything runs over your internet connection.

The platform includes desktop and mobile apps, so your team can make and receive calls from anywhere. It's built for businesses that need more than just a phone systemteams that want integrated communication tools for remote work and collaboration.

According to [Capterra reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/159047/Vonage-Business/), Vonage earns 4.0 out of 5 stars based on 320 user reviews. Users praise the feature set and call quality. Complaints center around customer service responsiveness and billing transparency (more on that shortly).

### Core Capabilities

[GetVoIP's 2025 review](https://getvoip.com/reviews/vonage-business-solutions/) highlights that Vonage offers over 40 calling features including:

- Advanced call management (forwarding, transfer, parking, simultaneous ring)
- Virtual receptionist with customizable call routing for different times of day
- Automatic call distribution to route callers to the right department
- Conference calling supporting up to 30 participants
- Voicemail-to-email and voicemail transcription
- Paperless fax (send/receive faxes digitally)
- Call flip (swap calls between devices mid-conversation)
- Call continuity (auto-reroute to backup numbers during outages)

Vonage advertises 99.999% uptime, which translates to about 5 minutes of downtime per year. For businesses relying on phone communication, that reliability matters.

### Who Vonage Works Best For

Vonage is designed for businesses with teams that need:

- Internal team collaboration (chat, video, screen sharing)
- Multi-location operations with centralized phone management
- CRM integration for sales teams
- Professional call handling with auto-attendants and queues

Where Vonage falls short: solo operators and small teams (1-5 people) who primarily need someone to answer customer calls 24/7. You're paying for enterprise collaboration features you might not use, while still missing calls when you're working.

## Vonage Features & Integration Ecosystem

### Call Management Features

Vonage's call management goes beyond basic forwarding:

**Follow Me** lets you set a sequence of numbers to ring. Example: desk phone rings for 10 seconds, then mobile rings if no answer, then goes to voicemail. You can customize the timing and sequence.

**Simultaneous Ring** makes multiple phones ring at onceyour desk phone and mobile, or route calls to your entire team so someone answers.

**Virtual Receptionist** (auto-attendant) provides menu-based call routing: "Press 1 for Sales, 2 for Support, 3 for Billing." You can set different menus for business hours, after hours, holidays, and lunch breaks.

The limitation? These are menu-based systems, not conversational AI. Callers navigate menus by pressing buttons, and someone still needs to be available to answer when the call routes through.

### CRM Integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho)

Vonage's Integration Suite connects with major CRM platforms through their marketplace. [Vonage for HubSpot](https://www.vonage.com/marketplace/unified-communications/hubspot/), for example, provides:

- Click-to-call from contact records
- Automatic call logging in CRM
- Screen pop-ups showing caller information when calls come in
- Post-call notes synced directly to CRM records

Supported integrations include:

- Salesforce
- HubSpot
- Microsoft Dynamics
- Zoho CRM
- SugarCRM
- G Suite / Google Workspace
- Office 365 / Microsoft 365
- Zendesk
- NetSuite
- ConnectWise

Research from the [US Chamber of Commerce](https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/voip-and-business-tools-integration) shows that companies with successful CRM-VoIP integrations report 30-40% improvements in call handling efficiency. Sales teams see caller context immediately, log interactions faster, and follow up more systematically.

The setup process varies by integration but generally requires admin approval and configuration through the Vonage admin portal.

### Vonage Integration Suite

The Vonage Integration Suite provides pre-built connectors for 20+ business applications. This is different from custom API integrationyou're working with templates that Vonage has already built.

**Pros:**
- Plug-and-play setup for supported apps
- Officially supported by Vonage
- Usually reliable and maintained

**Cons:**
- Limited to apps Vonage has built integrations for
- Requires admin approval in some cases
- Limited customization of what data syncs
- Can't easily connect to custom software or niche industry tools

For businesses using mainstream tools like Salesforce or HubSpot, this works fine. For businesses with custom CRMs, proprietary job management software, or specialized industry tools, the limitations become frustrating.

### Mobile & Remote Work Features

Vonage's mobile apps (iOS and Android) give you full phone system access from anywhere:

- Make/receive calls using your business number
- Access voicemail and call history
- Join video conferences
- Send team messages
- Call flip to switch devices mid-call

The "work from anywhere" feature means you can take your desk phone home or to a remote location and it works the same as in the office.

For distributed teams and remote workers, these features are valuable. For field service businesses where the owner is physically working on job sites, they don't solve the fundamental problem: you can't answer while your hands are dirty, you're on a ladder, or you're focused on the work in front of you.

## Vonage Pricing: What It Really Costs

### Advertised Pricing Plans

Vonage offers three main pricing tiers with annual billing (month-to-month costs are higher):

**Mobile Plan:**
- $13.99/user/month (annual contract)
- $19.99/user/month (month-to-month)
- Includes: Unlimited calling, texting, team messaging, mobile app

**Premium Plan:**
- $20.99/user/month (annual contract)
- $29.99/user/month (month-to-month)
- Adds: Video collaboration, integrations, desktop app

**Advanced Plan:**
- $27.99/user/month (annual contract)
- $39.99/user/month (month-to-month)
- Adds: Advanced call management, custom integrations, enhanced admin controls

Vonage currently runs a promotion offering 30% off standard rates for the duration of annual contracts (up to 99 lines), valid through January 31, 2026.

### The Hidden Cost Reality

Here's where advertised pricing diverges from reality. [Better Business Bureau reports](https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/atlanta/profile/voice-over-internet-protocol-sales-and-service/vonage-business-cloud-0443-27095553/complaints) include numerous complaints about misleading pricing practices:

"Advertised prices of $13.99 per line became $26-30 with taxes and fees."

The $13.99 Mobile plan is the base service fee. What's not immediately clear:

- Regulatory fees and taxes (varies by location, often $5-8/user)
- E911 fees ($1.50-2/user)
- Equipment costs if you buy Vonage phones
- Add-on features (call recording, AI assistant, advanced queues)

A more realistic monthly cost is $26-30 per user for the entry-level plan with all fees included.

Additionally, Vonage requires a 12-month contract to get the best pricing. If you cancel early, you'll pay a termination fee equal to the remaining contract value.

### Total Cost of Ownership

Let's calculate real annual costs for a 3-person HVAC company:

**Vonage Premium Plan (realistic):**
- 3 users � $30/month (actual with fees) = $90/month
- Annual cost: $90 � 12 = $1,080/year

**What you get:** Full-featured phone system with video, CRM integration, mobile/desktop apps, team chat.

**What you don't get:** Someone to answer calls when your team is on job sites.

Based on our call data, this business receiving 42 calls per month still misses 74.1% of them (31 calls). At a 20% conversion rate and $3,500 average project value:

31 missed calls � 20% conversion � $3,500 = $21,700/month lost = **$260,400/year in lost revenue**

Now compare to NextPhone:

**NextPhone:**
- $199/month flat rate (no per-user fees)
- Annual cost: $2,388/year

**What you get:** AI receptionist answers 24/7, qualifies leads, books appointments, routes emergencies, integrates with any CRM via webhooks.

**What you don't miss:** Those 31 calls. If NextPhone captures even 50% of the previously missed calls and converts at 20%, that's:
- 15.5 new customers � $3,500 = $54,250/month = $651,000/year in recovered revenue

**Net benefit:** $651,000 captured - $2,388 cost = **$648,612 annual gain** (272X ROI)

Even if you keep Vonage for internal team use and add NextPhone for customer calls, you're at $1,080 + $2,388 = $3,468/year total, still capturing hundreds of thousands in previously lost revenue.

## Adding AI to Your Vonage System

### What is SIP Integration?

SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) is the internet-based standard that VoIP systems use to establish and manage calls. Most modern business phone systems, including Vonage, support SIP.

According to this [SIP integration guide](https://blog.ai-receptionist.com/blogs/sip-integration-connect-ai-receptionist-to-voip.html), SIP integration creates a direct connection between AI platforms and VoIP systems, allowing them to work together seamlessly.

The technical setup involves configuring your AI platform to connect to your Vonage system via SIP credentials (IP address, username, password, port). Once connected, calls can flow between the systems.

### How AI + Vonage Works Together

With SIP integration, you can keep your existing Vonage infrastructure while adding an AI answering layer:

**Call Flow Example:**
1. Customer calls your business number
2. AI receptionist answers in under 5 seconds
3. AI handles routine questions (hours, pricing, availability)
4. For complex issues or customer requests, AI transfers to your Vonage extension
5. You receive the call with context (caller name, reason for call, urgency level)

**Benefits:**
- Keep your Vonage investment (no migration needed)
- AI provides 24/7 coverage for routine calls
- Your team only gets calls that need human attention
- Emergencies route immediately to on-call team member

**Use Cases:**
- Plumbing company: AI handles "What are your rates?" and "Are you open Sunday?" while routing "my basement is flooding" calls directly to the on-call plumber
- HVAC contractor: AI books maintenance appointments while transferring emergency "AC out in 98-degree heat" calls immediately
- Electrician: AI provides service area information and pricing ranges while routing "I smell smoke from my panel" calls to the owner's cell

### Setup Process Overview

Adding AI to Vonage via SIP typically involves:

1. **Choose SIP-compatible AI platform** (NextPhone supports this)
2. **Gather Vonage SIP credentials** from your admin portal
3. **Configure AI platform** with Vonage connection details
4. **Set up call routing rules** (what AI handles vs. what transfers)
5. **Test the integration** with test calls
6. **Go live** and monitor performance

Most businesses complete this setup in 1-2 days with support from their AI platform provider.

The limitation: this approach requires maintaining two systems. You're paying for both Vonage and the AI platform. For some businesses, this makes sensekeep the existing investment, add intelligence on top. For others, a complete migration to an AI-first platform is simpler and more cost-effective.

## NextPhone vs. Vonage Integration Ecosystem

### Vonage Integration Suite: Pre-Built Connectors

Vonage's approach to integrations is curated: they build official connectors for major platforms and make them available through the Vonage Marketplace.

**What's included:**
- 20+ pre-built integrations (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics, Zoho, etc.)
- Official support from Vonage
- Standardized setup process
- Integration configuration through admin portal

**How it works:**
You browse the marketplace, select the integration you need (e.g., HubSpot), request admin approval, and follow the setup wizard. Vonage's connector handles the authentication and data sync between platforms.

**Limitations:**
- Only works with apps Vonage has built integrations for
- Limited customization (you get what Vonage built)
- Can't easily integrate with custom software, proprietary CRMs, or niche industry tools
- Some integrations require higher-tier plans (Premium or Advanced)

For a marketing agency using standard tools like HubSpot and Slack, this works great. For a specialty contractor using custom job management software built specifically for their trade, you're out of luck.

### NextPhone Custom Webhooks: Unlimited Flexibility

NextPhone takes a different approach: instead of pre-built integrations for specific apps, it provides custom HTTP webhooks that can connect to any system with an API.

**How webhooks work:**
During or after calls, the AI can send structured data to any URL you specify. You define:
- What data to collect (name, email, company, project details, budget, urgencyanything)
- Where to send it (your CRM API, Zapier, Make, Google Sheets, custom database)
- When to trigger (during call, after call, on specific conditions)

**Example: Custom CRM Integration**
A general contractor uses proprietary job management software. With webhooks, NextPhone can:
1. Collect caller information during the call (name, address, project type, timeline)
2. Send POST request to the contractor's CRM API with structured data
3. Create new lead record automatically with call transcript and audio recording link
4. Trigger follow-up automation (send estimate request email, schedule callback)

**Template variables available:**
- All AI-collected parameters (fully customizable)
- `{{caller_number}}` - Caller's phone
- `{{receiving_number}}` - Your business phone
- `{{owner_name}}` - Business owner name
- `{{website}}` - Your website
- `{{booking_url}}` - Auto-extracted from knowledge base

**Real-world example:**
An HVAC company uses NextPhone to:
- Push leads to ServiceTitan (field service software) via API
- Log calls in Google Sheets for reporting
- Send emergency alerts to PagerDuty when urgency keywords detected
- Trigger SMS via Twilio to send appointment confirmations
- Update inventory management system when parts inquiries come in

All of this happens automatically during or after calls, with zero manual data entry.

### Which Approach Works Better?

**Choose Vonage Integration Suite if:**
- You only use mainstream tools (Salesforce, HubSpot, Microsoft 365)
- You want plug-and-play setup with minimal configuration
- You have IT staff to manage integrations
- You're already invested in the Vonage ecosystem

**Choose NextPhone Webhooks if:**
- You use custom software or niche industry tools
- You need to integrate with multiple systems simultaneously
- You want full control over what data syncs where
- You use automation platforms like Zapier or Make
- You're a small business without IT staff (webhooks are actually simpler once set up)

The flexibility difference is significant. Vonage gives you 20 integration options. NextPhone gives you unlimitedif it has an API, you can connect to it.

## Three Paths for Vonage Users

### Path 1: Add AI to Existing Vonage (SIP Integration)

**Best for:** Businesses happy with Vonage's team collaboration features but need better call coverage.

**How it works:**
- Keep Vonage for internal team calls, video meetings, team chat
- Add NextPhone AI as your customer-facing answering layer
- Connect via SIP so AI can transfer calls to Vonage extensions
- AI handles routine calls 24/7, transfers complex calls to your team

**Cost:**
- Vonage: $1,080/year (3 users at realistic pricing)
- NextPhone: $2,388/year
- Total: $3,468/year

**ROI:**
If AI captures just 50% of previously missed calls:
- 15.5 calls/month � 20% conversion � $3,500 = $10,850/month saved
- Annual recovery: $130,200
- Net benefit: $130,200 - $3,468 = $126,732/year (36X ROI)

**Pros:**
- Keep existing investment
- Gradual transition (lower risk)
- Team keeps familiar tools

**Cons:**
- Higher total cost (paying for two systems)
- More complex setup (two platforms to manage)
- Redundant features (both have call routing, voicemail, etc.)

### Path 2: Hybrid Approach (NextPhone + Vonage Together)

**Best for:** Larger teams (5-10+ people) that need internal collaboration tools AND 24/7 customer call answering.

**How it works:**
- Use Vonage for internal team communication (employees call each other, video meetings, team chat)
- Use NextPhone exclusively for customer-facing calls (different number or forward customer line to NextPhone)
- Keep systems separate with clear purposes

**Example:**
8-person marketing agency:
- Vonage: Team members call each other, internal meetings, screen sharing for client presentations
- NextPhone: Handles all inbound client inquiries, books discovery calls, qualifies leads, routes urgent client issues to account managers

**Cost:**
- Vonage: $2,880/year (8 users � $30/month � 12)
- NextPhone: $2,388/year
- Total: $5,268/year

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds (collaboration + AI answering)
- Clear separation of internal vs. customer calls
- Scales well for growing teams

**Cons:**
- Highest cost option
- Managing two systems
- Team needs to understand which system to use when

### Path 3: Migrate to AI-First Platform (Full NextPhone)

**Best for:** Solo operators and small teams (1-5 people) where customer calls are the primary need.

**How it works:**
- Port your number from Vonage to NextPhone
- Cancel Vonage subscription
- Use NextPhone for all inbound customer calls
- Use mobile carrier or simple VoIP for team-to-team calls if needed

**Cost:**
- NextPhone: $2,388/year
- Total: $2,388/year (save $1,080 vs. keeping Vonage)

**ROI:**
Capturing 50% of previously missed calls:
- 15.5 calls/month � 20% conversion � $3,500 = $10,850/month
- Annual recovery: $130,200
- Net benefit: $130,200 - $2,388 = $127,812/year (53X ROI)

**Pros:**
- Lowest cost
- Simplest setup (one platform)
- AI-first approach (built for answering, not retrofitted)
- No contracts or cancellation fees

**Cons:**
- Lose Vonage's team collaboration features
- Need alternative for team calls/video (Zoom, Google Meet, etc.)
- Requires porting number (10-15 day process)

### Decision Framework: Which Path is Right?

Ask yourself these questions:

**1. Do you need team collaboration tools (video, team chat, conference calling)?**
- Yes, frequently � Path 1 or Path 2
- Rarely or never � Path 3

**2. How many team members take customer calls?**
- 1-3 people � Path 3 (migrate)
- 4-8 people � Path 1 or Path 2
- 9+ people � Path 2 (hybrid)

**3. Are you happy with Vonage's service and support?**
- Yes, it works well � Path 1 (add AI)
- Frustrated with pricing/support � Path 3 (migrate)

**4. What's your primary pain point?**
- Missing after-hours calls � Path 1 (add AI for coverage)
- Missing calls anytime (even business hours) � Path 3 (need full AI coverage)
- Need both team tools AND better answering � Path 2 (hybrid)

**5. What's your budget?**
- Minimize cost � Path 3 ($2,388/year)
- Already paying for Vonage, want to keep it � Path 1 ($3,468/year)
- Need comprehensive solution, budget isn't the constraint � Path 2 ($5,268/year)

For most small home services businesses (contractors, plumbers, electricians, HVAC), Path 3 makes the most sense. You don't need enterprise collaboration featuresyou need someone to answer the phone when customers call.

## How to Migrate from Vonage

If you've decided Path 3 is right (full migration to NextPhone), here's the step-by-step process.

### Before You Start: Contract Review

First, check your Vonage contract:

1. **Find your contract end date** - Log into admin portal or check your original agreement
2. **Calculate early termination fee** - Vonage typically charges the remaining contract value if you cancel early
3. **Compare to ROI** - If you're 6 months into a 12-month contract and termination fee is $180, but you'll save $10,850/month in captured calls, the math is clear

**Example calculation:**
- Remaining contract: 6 months � $30 = $180 termination fee
- Monthly benefit from NextPhone: $10,850 (50% of missed calls captured)
- Break-even: 0.5 days (the termination fee is recovered in hours)

Vonage requires authorization from the account owner to port numbers. Make sure you have:
- Account number
- PIN or password
- Authorized user name matching the account

### Number Porting Process (10-15 Days)

According to [CloudTalk's porting guide](https://www.cloudtalk.io/blog/port-a-number-from-vonage/), porting from Vonage takes 10-15 business days.

**Step-by-step:**

**Day 1:** Submit port request with NextPhone
- Provide current Vonage account details
- Fill out Letter of Authorization (LOA) with authorized signature
- Specify which numbers to port (you can port multiple numbers simultaneously)

**Day 2-3:** NextPhone submits port request to Vonage
- Vonage receives request and begins validation

**Day 4-7:** Vonage validates request
- Checks that account info matches
- Confirms authorized user
- Verifies no outstanding balances (pay your final Vonage bill)

**Day 8-12:** Port scheduled
- Both carriers coordinate switch date
- You'll receive confirmation of port date/time

**Day 13-15:** Port completes
- Switch happens instantly (usually during business hours)
- Your number now routes to NextPhone
- Zero downtimethe transition is seamless

**Important:** Your number remains active with Vonage during the entire process. You won't miss calls during the porting period.

**Common delays:**
- Mismatched account information (double-check spelling, account numbers)
- Outstanding balance on Vonage account (pay bills before porting)
- Unsigned or incorrectly signed LOA (make sure authorized account holder signs)

Vonage doesn't charge for port-out requests. You only pay potential early termination fees if you're canceling mid-contract.

### Setup & Testing

While waiting for the port to complete, set up NextPhone:

1. **Website analysis** - NextPhone's AI scans your website and auto-extracts business info, services, hours, FAQs
2. **Customize responses** - Review and adjust how AI answers common questions
3. **Set up integrations** - Configure webhooks to push data to your CRM
4. **Define emergency routing** - Specify which keywords trigger immediate transfer to your phone
5. **Test with temporary number** - NextPhone provides test number to try the system before port completes

Most businesses complete setup in 2-4 hours. The AI handles most configuration automatically based on your website content.

### Switchover Day

On port completion day:

1. **Morning of port:** Make test call to verify number routes to NextPhone
2. **Confirm AI is working:** Check that AI answers correctly, transfers work, integrations push data
3. **Monitor first few hours:** Listen to recordings, adjust responses if needed
4. **Cancel Vonage:** Once confident everything works, cancel Vonage account (if you haven't already)

**Pro tip:** Schedule ports for Tuesday or Wednesday (avoid Mondays and Fridays when support teams are busy).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use AI with my existing Vonage system?

Yes, absolutely. Via SIP integration, an AI receptionist like NextPhone can connect to your Vonage system. The AI answers calls, collects information, handles routine questions, and can transfer calls to Vonage extensions when needed.

This lets you keep your existing Vonage infrastructure while adding 24/7 intelligent call handling. You're essentially layering AI coverage on top of your current setup. Learn more about [how SIP integration works](/how-it-works).

### How much does Vonage really cost with all the fees?

While Vonage advertises plans starting at $13.99/user/month, customers consistently report actual costs of $26-30/month per user after taxes, regulatory fees, E911 charges, and add-ons.

The [Better Business Bureau has numerous complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/atlanta/profile/voice-over-internet-protocol-sales-and-service/vonage-business-cloud-0443-27095553/complaints) about this pricing discrepancy. Always request a total cost quote including all fees before committing to Vonage.

Compare this to NextPhone's transparent $199/month flat rate with no per-user fees, no contracts, and no hidden charges.

### Will I lose calls during the porting process?

No. Your phone number remains fully active with Vonage during the entire 10-15 day porting process. The switch happens instantly once approvedcalls immediately start routing to your new system with zero gap in service.

The port typically completes during business hours on a scheduled day. One moment calls route to Vonage, the next moment they route to NextPhone. No downtime, no missed calls.

### Can NextPhone integrate with my CRM like Vonage does?

Yes, and with more flexibility. While Vonage offers pre-built integrations for major CRMs (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.), NextPhone uses custom HTTP webhooks that can connect to any system with an API.

This means you can integrate with:
- Custom databases and proprietary software
- Niche industry-specific CRMs
- Zapier or Make for multi-tool workflows
- Google Sheets, Airtable, or other spreadsheet tools
- Job management systems, project management tools, invoicing software

You define exactly what data to collect and where to send it. See [NextPhone's webhook integrations](/integrations) for examples.

### What happens to my Vonage hardware if I switch?

If you're using Vonage-provided IP phones, you'll need to return them according to your contract or purchase them outright (check your agreement).

NextPhone is software-based and doesn't require proprietary hardware. It works via:
- Mobile app (iOS and Android)
- Desktop app (Mac and Windows)
- SIP-compatible phones (if you prefer desk phones)
- Web browser

Many businesses find this more flexibleyour team can answer from anywhere without dedicated hardware.

### How long does it take to set up NextPhone?

Most businesses are fully operational within 24-48 hours. NextPhone includes AI-powered website analysis that automatically extracts:
- Your business name and description
- Services you offer
- Hours of operation
- Common questions and answers
- Knowledge base content

### What if I'm locked into a Vonage contract?

Review your contract carefully for the early termination fee. Vonage typically requires 12-month commitments, and canceling early means paying the remaining contract value.

Calculate the cancellation cost versus the revenue you're losing from missed calls. Based on our data, contractors miss an average of $21,700 per month in potential revenue. Even a $500 early termination fee is recovered in hours, not months.

For many businesses, the ROI of switching justifies eating the early termination fee. For others, waiting until contract end makes sense. Run the numbers for your specific situation.

## Stop Missing Calls: Your Next Steps

VoIP phone systems like Vonage offer powerful featurescall forwarding, CRM integration, team collaboration, mobile apps. But features don't answer calls. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 businesses, 74.1% went unanswered despite having VoIP systems in place.

The missing piece isn't better call routing or more integrations. It's intelligent, 24/7 call answering that actually picks up the phone.

You have three paths forward:

1. **Add AI to Vonage** via SIP if you're happy with your current system but need after-hours coverage
2. **Use both platforms** (hybrid approach) if you have a larger team needing collaboration tools plus customer call answering
3. **Migrate to AI-first** platform if you're a small team and customer calls are your priority

For most small businessescontractors, plumbers, electricians, HVAC companies, service providersPath 3 delivers the highest ROI with the simplest setup. You don't need enterprise features. You need to answer every call.

The businesses winning in 2025 aren't the ones with the most sophisticated phone systems. They're the ones who never miss a call.
