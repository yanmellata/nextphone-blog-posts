4. **Real Estate Call Volume Data** - No one uses actual missed call statistics for real estate teams
5. **Showing Coordination Workflow** - How to route showing requests to available agents automatically
6. **ROI for Real Estate Teams** - Generic efficiency claims, not specific to commission-based revenue
