## Introduction

Your Gmail is integrated. Your Google Calendar syncs perfectly. [Copper CRM](https://www.copper.com/google-workspace-crm) logs every email conversation. You've built the perfect Google Workspace stack.

But your phone keeps ringing. And you can't answer.

In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

[Copper CRM](https://www.copper.com/google-workspace-crm) is Google's recommended CRM for Workspace users. It handles email and calendar brilliantly. But it doesn't answer your phone. Here's how to complete the stack with AI phone integration.

## Why Copper CRM Users Chose Google Workspace

### Google Workspace Native CRM

Copper is the only CRM solution that's a Recommended for Google Workspace app, a Chrome Enterprise Partner, and a Google-backed company. It's built specifically for teams that live in Gmail, Calendar, and Drive.

The integration is native, not bolted on. Add contacts directly from Gmail. View customer history without leaving your inbox. Schedule follow-ups that sync with Google Calendar instantly. Access files from Drive right inside customer records.

According to Matthew Izaat, [Google Cloud Product Manager](https://www.copy.ai/go-to-market-tools/copper-review), "customers value a best-in-class CRM solution with deep, native integration to critical Workspace apps such as Gmail, Drive and Calendar."

### Who Uses Copper

Small teams that chose Google Workspace over Microsoft or other ecosystems. Agencies, consulting firms, contractors, real estate agents. Typically 5-50 people. Teams that want powerful CRM features without leaving the Google tools they already use.

[Copper CRM pricing](https://www.copper.com/pricing) starts at $25/user per month for the Basic plan. The Professional plan at $59/user per month includes third-party integrations—which brings us to the phone problem.

## The Phone Call Gap

### The Missed Call Problem

Copper CRM doesn't answer phone calls. It logs emails, tracks calendar events, and manages contacts. But when a potential customer calls? You're on your own.

That's a problem if you're:

- On a job site and can't reach your phone
- In a client meeting
- Focused on actual work
- Running a small team without a receptionist
- Getting calls after business hours

We analyzed 13,175 calls from 47 contractors over 7 months. The data is brutal: 74.1% went completely unanswered.

As one plumber from our study put it: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

### Revenue Impact for Small Businesses

Here's the math. A typical small contractor receives about 42 calls per month. If 74.1% go unanswered, that's 31 missed calls. If just 20% of those would have converted at an average project value of $3,500:

31 missed calls � 20% conversion � $3,500 = $21,700 per month lost

That's $260,400 per year in revenue walking away because you couldn't answer the phone.

The [call logging market](https://www.breakcold.com/blog/crm-call-tracking) is growing from $2.3 billion in 2021 to a projected $4.1 billion by 2026. Businesses know they're losing money. They're looking for solutions.

## Current Copper Phone Integration Options

### Manual Calling Integrations (CloudTalk, JustCall, RingCentral)

Copper integrates with several phone systems: [CloudTalk](https://www.cloudtalk.io/copper/), [JustCall](https://justcall.io/integration/copper/), RingCentral, and Kixie.

These are solid tools. They let you click-to-dial contacts directly from Copper. They automatically log call duration, notes, and recordings. According to CloudTalk's research, companies that integrate their CRM with calling platforms report 30% faster customer response times and a 40% drop in manual data entry.

### What They Do Well

You get automatic call logging. Click a contact in Copper, the phone system dials. The call gets logged automatically with duration and notes. You can see call history right in the CRM.

For outbound sales teams, this is efficient. No more typing in phone numbers. No more forgetting to log calls.

### The Limitation: You Still Have to Answer

Here's what these integrations don't solve: missed calls.

CloudTalk, JustCall, and RingCentral are calling tools for when you're available to answer. They help you make calls and log them. But if you can't answer—because you're on a ladder, in a meeting, or asleep at 9 PM—the call still goes to voicemail.

The lead is still lost.

| Feature | Traditional Phone Systems | NextPhone AI Integration |
|---------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Requires you to answer** | Yes | No - AI answers automatically |
| **24/7 coverage** | Only if you're available | Yes |
| **Call logging** | Manual or semi-automatic | Fully automatic |
| **Data collection** | You ask questions | AI asks and logs |
| **Missed call handling** | Voicemail | AI conversation + CRM logging |

## How NextPhone Integrates with Copper CRM

### AI Answers First, Then Logs to Copper

NextPhone takes a different approach. Instead of helping you make calls, it answers calls for you.

The AI receptionist picks up in under 5 seconds. Every time. Even at 2 AM on Sunday.

"Thanks for calling [Your Business]. How can I help you today?"

The caller explains what they need. The AI asks clarifying questions. It collects the information you care about: caller name, phone number, email, company name, reason for call, project details, budget, timeline.

All while having a natural conversation.

### What Data Gets Captured

You configure what information the AI should collect. Standard fields:

- Caller name and phone number
- Email address
- Company name
- Reason for calling
- Service interest
- Budget range
- Preferred contact time

Custom fields based on your business:

- Property address (for contractors)
- Square footage (for cleaning services)
- Current provider (for service businesses)
- Urgency level

Whatever you need to qualify a lead or route a call properly.

### Real-Time CRM Sync

Here's where the Copper integration happens. As the AI collects information during the call, it pushes data to Copper's API via HTTP webhook.

Not after the call. During the call.

The lead appears in Copper CRM within seconds. By the time the call ends, you have a complete record: caller details, conversation summary, next steps.

If it's urgent15.9% of our analyzed calls contained urgency keywords like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP"the AI can transfer the call to your cell phone immediately while still logging everything to Copper.

## Benefits for Google Workspace Teams

### Complete the Google Stack

You chose Google Workspace because it works seamlessly. Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docseverything syncs.

You chose Copper because it's the native CRM for that ecosystem.

NextPhone completes the stack. Now your phone system feeds directly into your CRM, which syncs with your Google Calendar, which connects to your Gmail.

No missed calls. No lost leads. No switching between disconnected tools.

### 24/7 Coverage Without Hiring

The alternative to missing calls is hiring a receptionist. Full-time receptionist salary: $35,000 per year ($2,900 per month). Plus benefits, sick days, vacation coverage.

Or you could add a phone integration to your existing Copper setup:

- Copper Professional: $59/user/month
- CloudTalk (manual calling): ~$25/user/month
- Total: $84/month

That gets you click-to-dial. But you still have to be available to answer incoming calls.

NextPhone: $199/month, unlimited calls. AI answers 24/7. Never misses a call.

### ROI for Small Teams

Let's say you're a 3-person consulting firm using Google Workspace and Copper. You can't justify hiring a receptionist. But you're losing calls.

Capture just one additional $3,500 project per month because NextPhone answered a call you would have missed.

$3,500 revenue � $199 NextPhone cost = 17.6x return

Even one extra lead per month pays for the integration 17 times over.

For context, our data shows that 25.4% of calls include explicit callback requests. Without a system to answer and track those requests, most fall through the cracks. NextPhone captures every one.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Copper CRM have built-in phone calling?

No, Copper doesn't have native phone calling features. It's a CRM, not a phone system. It integrates with third-party phone platforms like CloudTalk, JustCall, RingCentral, and NextPhone. You need a separate phone integration to make or receive calls.

### How does NextPhone differ from CloudTalk or JustCall?

CloudTalk and JustCall are manual calling tools. You click to dial, you answer incoming calls, you log notes. They're designed for sales teams actively making calls.

NextPhone is an AI receptionist that answers calls automatically, 24/7. It doesn't wait for you to be available. It captures leads even when you're unavailable, asleep, or focused on other work. CloudTalk and JustCall only help when you're already at your desk.

### What information can NextPhone collect and send to Copper?

NextPhone can collect any information you configure: caller name, phone number, email, company name, reason for call, project details, budget, timeline. You define custom fields based on your business needs. All data is pushed to Copper's API in real-time during the call via HTTP webhook.

### How much does it cost to integrate NextPhone with Copper?

NextPhone costs $199/month for unlimited calls. You'll also need Copper's Professional plan at $59/user/month, which includes API access for third-party integrations. There are no additional integration fees. Compare this to hiring a full-time receptionist at $35,000/year ($2,900/month). See [NextPhone pricing](https://getnextphone.com/pricing) for details.

### Is this suitable for small teams?

Yes. NextPhone is designed for small teams (5-20 people) who can't afford full-time reception staff but can't afford to miss calls. It's ideal for businesses already using Google Workspace and Copper CRM who want to complete their tech stack. Setup takes hours, not weeks. No technical expertise required.

## Complete Your Google Workspace Stack

Copper CRM is the best CRM for Google Workspace users. Native integration, no context switching, built specifically for teams that live in Gmail and Calendar.

But it doesn't answer your phone. And 74.1% of those callspotential customers, urgent requests, callback opportunitiesgo unanswered.
