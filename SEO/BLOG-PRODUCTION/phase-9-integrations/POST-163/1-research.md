- NextPhone: $199/mo unlimited calls
- ROI comparison: NextPhone saves 93% vs receptionist, simpler than Mitel

**NextPhone Integration Capabilities (from Factbase):**
- Custom HTTP webhooks (can integrate with ANY system, including Mitel if needed)
- CRM integration (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive - no complex API needed)
- SMS follow-up (Twilio-powered)
- Email notifications (real-time)
- Call transfer (can transfer to Mitel extensions if needed)

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that 74.1% of calls went completely unansweredeven when businesses had phone systems in place."

## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. What Mitel is (enterprise PBX/VoIP system)
2. Mitel integration capabilities (CRM, API, partnerships)
3. Deployment options (cloud, on-premise, hybrid)
4. Migration challenges (EOL, complexity, cost)
5. Alternative solutions comparison

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

1. **AI-First Alternative**
   - Competitors: Focus on VoIP-to-VoIP migration (Mitel ’ RingCentral, Nextiva, etc.)
   - We'll do: Position AI receptionist as the FRONT LINE that solves the core problem (missed calls, after-hours, routing) without complex PBX replacement

2. **SMB Reality Check**
   - Competitors: Enterprise focus, technical jargon, complex migration paths
   - We'll do: Show small business owner perspective"You don't need a $50K PBX migration, you need calls answered"

3. **Real Cost Transparency**
   - Competitors: Vague pricing, "contact sales" CTAs
   - We'll do: Show exact numbers: $35K receptionist vs $199 NextPhone vs $2K-5K Mitel setup

4. **Hybrid Integration Approach**
   - Competitors: "Replace Mitel entirely" or "Keep Mitel forever"
   - We'll do: "Use NextPhone AI as first line, transfer complex calls to existing Mitel system" (best of both worlds)

5. **Webhook Integration Simplicity**
   - Competitors: Talk about complex APIs and developer requirements
   - We'll do: Show how NextPhone's HTTP webhooks work with ANY system in minutes, no developer needed

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Most Mitel integration guides focus on complex enterprise migrations or CRM APIs. We're taking a different approach: position NextPhone as the AI front line that handles 85% of calls (quotes, scheduling, routing, callbacks) while integrating seamlessly with existing systemsincluding Mitelvia simple webhooks. Perfect for small businesses stuck between expensive PBX systems and the reality of missed calls."

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More practical** (SMB focus vs enterprise complexity)
2. **More affordable** (transparent pricing: $199/mo vs $2K+ setups)
3. **Faster to implement** (hours vs weeks/months for Mitel migration)
4. **Better data** (13,175 call analysis showing the REAL problem is missed calls, not integration)
5. **Hybrid approach** (work WITH Mitel or replace itcustomer choice)
