- CRM and calendar syncing
- Reminder workflows
- No-show reduction

**Content Gaps (Opportunities):**
1. **Voice-to-calendar booking focus** - Competitors: Mention voice AI but don't detail the voice booking UX, We'll do: Show specific call flow, real conversation examples, how AI checks availability in real-time during calls
2. **SMB home services angle** - Competitors: Focus on SaaS, enterprise, or generic businesses, We'll do: Target contractors, tradespeople with specific scenarios (on roof, can't text link)
3. **Transparent pricing + ROI** - Competitors: Don't show costs or ROI calculations, We'll do: Show NextPhone $199/mo vs alternatives, calculate value of captured appointments
4. **Meeting type selection during calls** - Competitors: Assume user texts link or uses web, We'll do: Show how AI can ask "Would you like a 30-minute estimate or 60-minute consultation?" and book accordingly
5. **Reschedule/cancel automation** - Competitors: Mention it exists but don't detail workflow, We'll do: Show complete automation loop (call ’ reschedule request ’ AI handles it ’ calendar updates)
6. **Proprietary call data** - Competitors: Generic stats or vendor case studies, We'll do: Lead with NextPhone's 13,175 call analysis, 25.4% callback requests, 7.7% scheduling requests

**Best Practices:**
- Avg word count: 1,500-2,500 words
- Common format: Guide with step-by-step or use case format
- Data usage: Some use case studies (Thoughtly 90 sec booking, Smith.ai 26% increase), but most lack hard data

## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

**Reddit Insights:**
- "Calendly is not easy to configure and the free version is very limited" - r/professors (via ClickUp review)
- "Cold email with a Calendly link in my opinion is not a best practice. You haven't provided any value or reason to book an appointment" - Reddit user
