**Key Points to Cover:**

- **Total:** ~$425-633/month for solo contractor with one admin
- **Lost Revenue:** $260,400/year from 74.1% missed calls

- **With AI:** Capture 50% of missed calls = $130,200/year recovered
- **Cost:** $625/month × 12 = $7,500/year
- **ROI:** $130,200 - $7,500 = $122,700 net gain = 1,636% ROI

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Real scenario: Small plumbing company, 2 employees, both in field
- Before: Missing 31 calls/month = $260K/year lost
