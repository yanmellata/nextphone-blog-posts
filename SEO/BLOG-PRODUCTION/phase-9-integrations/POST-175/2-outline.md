**H2 Title:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Purpose:** Address remaining questions and objections
**Word Count Target:** 300-400 words (5-7 questions)

---

### FAQ #1: Can I integrate any phone system with Microsoft Teams?

**Answer Outline:**
- Yes, multiple options exist: Microsoft Teams Phone (native), Direct Routing (connect existing carrier via SBC), Operator Connect (certified telecom partners), or third-party integrations like NextPhone
- Traditional approach: Direct Routing requires Session Border Controller setup (complex, expensive)
- Modern approach: Cloud services like NextPhone use webhooks/APIs to push call data to Teams (simpler, faster)

**Link:** External link to Microsoft Teams Phone options

---

### FAQ #2: How much does Microsoft Teams Phone cost?

**Answer Outline:**
- Microsoft Teams Phone System: $8/user/month (requires Office 365)
- Domestic Calling Plan: Additional $12/user/month
- International Calling Plan: $25-35/user/month
- Total: $20-43/user/month minimum, not including setup costs for Direct Routing
- Alternative: Third-party integrations like NextPhone ($199/month flat, unlimited calls)

**Link:** External link to Microsoft licensing page

---

### FAQ #3: What's the difference between call routing and call queues?

**Answer Outline:**
- Call routing: Directing calls to appropriate destination based on rules (time of day, caller number, keywords)
- Call queues: Holding area where calls wait for available agent, plays hold music, provides position in queue
- Voice-enabled channels combine both: Route call to channel, notify team members, first available answers
- Modern AI systems skip the queue entirely - answer immediately, handle routine questions, only transfer complex issues

**Link:** Internal link to How It Works page

---

### FAQ #4: Can AI really handle customer calls accurately?

**Answer Outline:**
- Modern AI achieves 85-95% accuracy for routine inquiries (hours, pricing, scheduling, FAQs)
- Key is training AI on your specific business knowledge
- AI excels at: Collecting information, answering common questions, routing to right person/channel
- AI struggles with: Complex negotiations, emotional situations, unique edge cases
- Best approach: AI handles routine (90% of calls), routes complex to humans, syncs everything to Teams

**Link:** None

### FAQ #6: What if my team doesn't use Microsoft Teams?

**Answer Outline:**
- Teams integration is optional - modern call platforms can sync to whatever you use
- NextPhone integrates with: Teams, Slack, email, CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce), SMS, custom webhooks
- Philosophy: "Meet you where you work" - don't force tool switching
- Most businesses already use Teams (270+ million monthly users), but integration works with your existing workflow

**Link:** Internal link to integrations page

---

### FAQ #7: How long does setup take?

**Answer Outline:**
- Traditional Microsoft Teams Phone + Direct Routing: 2-6 weeks (requires IT, SBC configuration, carrier coordination)
- Voice-enabled channels: 1-2 days (create resource account, call queue, connect channel)
- AI integration like NextPhone: 1-2 hours (connect webhook, configure routing rules, train AI on your business)
