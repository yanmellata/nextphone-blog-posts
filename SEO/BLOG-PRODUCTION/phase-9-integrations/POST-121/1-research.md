## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 74.1% missed calls ’ Use in: Introduction (why HubSpot integration matters)
- 25.4% callbacks requested ’ Use in: Benefits section (automatic callback logging)
- 15.9% urgency calls ’ Use in: Activity logging (priority tagging)
- 6.2% emergencies ’ Use in: Deal creation (high-value opportunity detection)

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." ’ Use in: Introduction (problem statement)

**Industry Examples:**
- **Home Services:** 42 calls/month average, 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed opportunities
- **Contractors:** Each missed estimate = $3,500-$8,000 potential job
- **Emergency calls:** Average $4,200 revenue (higher than routine work)

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% close rate × $3,500 avg = **$21,700/month lost**
- HubSpot integration captures these leads automatically
- With NextPhone + HubSpot: Every call logged, qualified leads in CRM instantly
- ROI: Capture just 3 extra jobs/month = $10,500 revenue vs $199/mo cost = **5,200% ROI**

**NextPhone Integration Capabilities (from Factbase):**

**HTTP Webhooks (Live & Powerful):**
- Send structured data to ANY external system during or after calls
- Fully customizable HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.)
- Dynamic template resolution with AI-collected data
- Supports service role tokens, API keys, custom headers

**Template Variables Available:**
- `{{caller_number}}` - Caller's phone
- `{{receiving_number}}` - Your business phone
- `{{owner_name}}` - Business owner name
- `{{website}}` - Your website
- `{{booking_url}}` - Auto-extracted from knowledge base
- `{{first_name}}` - Collected during call
- `{{email}}` - Collected during call
- `{{company_name}}` - Collected during call
- `{{message}}` - Call notes/details

**Example HubSpot Integration (from Factbase):**
```json
{
  "type": "http",
  "tool_name": "submitLeadToCRM",
  "description": "Save lead information to CRM when caller expresses interest",
  "http_method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.hubspot.com/contacts/v1/contact",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  "body_template": {
    "properties": [
      { "property": "firstname", "value": "{{first_name}}" },
      { "property": "phone", "value": "{{caller_number}}" },
      { "property": "email", "value": "{{email}}" },
      { "property": "company", "value": "{{company_name}}" },
      { "property": "notes", "value": "{{message}}" }
    ]
  },
  "parameters": [
    { "name": "first_name", "type": "string", "description": "Caller's name" },
    { "name": "email", "type": "string", "description": "Caller's email" },
    { "name": "company_name", "type": "string", "description": "Company name" },
    { "name": "message", "type": "string", "description": "Details about inquiry" }
  ]
}
```

**How the AI Collects Data During Calls:**
- Ask custom questions (configurable per business)
- Collect structured information: Name, email, phone, company, reason for call, budget, timeline, project details
- Any custom fields you define
- All data flows to HubSpot via webhook

**Real-Time Integration Execution:**
- **During calls:** AI can trigger integrations while talking to caller
- **After calls:** Automatic notifications and data syncing
- **Fail-safe:** Integrations fail silently to never interrupt call experience

**Data Flow Example:**
1. Caller contacts business
2. AI answers, engages in conversation
3. AI asks custom questions ("What service are you interested in?")
4. AI collects: name, email, company, requirements
5. **After call:** Auto-sends lead to HubSpot via webhook, creates contact, logs activity, associates with deal if needed

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% went completely unanswered. Every one of those missed calls could have been automatically logged in HubSpot."
 "NextPhone's HTTP webhook integration pushes structured data to HubSpot in real-time, using template variables like {{caller_number}}, {{email}}, and {{first_name}} collected during the conversation."
