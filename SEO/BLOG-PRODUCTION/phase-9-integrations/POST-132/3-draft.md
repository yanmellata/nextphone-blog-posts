# Insightly CRM + NextPhone: Project-Based Business Integration

**Key Takeaways:**

- Insightly combines CRM and project management, making it ideal for agencies and consultants tracking client relationships and deliverables
- 74.1% of business calls go unansweredwhen you're in client meetings or on-site, missed calls mean lost projects
- NextPhone integrates with Insightly via webhooks to automatically log calls, transcripts, and AI-collected data directly into contact and project records
- The integration captures client information 24/7 and syncs it to your CRM within seconds of the call ending
- For agencies averaging 42 calls/month, preventing missed opportunities can recover $31,000/month in lost project revenue

You're presenting a proposal to your biggest client. Your phone rings. The screen shows an unfamiliar numbercould be a referral, could be a $15,000 project inquiry. You let it ring. They leave a voicemail. By the time you listen to it three hours later, they've already hired someone else.

In [our analysis of 13,175 calls](https://getnextphone.com) from 47 businesses over 7 months, 74.1% of incoming calls went unanswered. For agencies and consultants, each missed call isn't just an inconvenienceit's a potential project lost to a faster competitor.

## The Cost of Missed Calls for Project-Based Businesses

### Why Agencies Miss Client Calls

Agencies and consultants face a unique challenge. You're not sitting at a desk waiting for the phone to ring. You're in client presentations, on-site at project locations, facilitating workshops, or deep in focused work. Unlike retail businesses where calls are routine inquiries, your calls could represent $5,000 to $50,000 projects.

The problem gets worse when you consider callback management. According to our study, 25.4% of callers explicitly request callbacks. Without a systematic way to track these requests in your CRM, most fall through the cracks. A sticky note gets buried. An email gets lost. A potential client moves on.

### The Revenue Impact

Let's do the math. For an agency receiving 42 calls per month (the average in our study):

- 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls per month
- If 20% of those convert at an average project value of $5,000
- That's $31,000 in lost monthly revenueor $372,000 per year

One of the contractors in our study said it best: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

## Why Insightly Works for Agencies and Consultants

### CRM + Project Management in One Platform

Most CRMs stop at "deal won." You track a lead, nurture it through your pipeline, close the deal, and then...what? You switch to a separate project management tool, losing all that valuable context.

[Insightly is different](https://www.g2.com/products/insightly-crm/reviews). It combines CRM and project management in one platform. When you win a deal, you convert it directly into a project with timelines, milestones, task assignments, and deliverablesall while maintaining the full history of how that client found you and every conversation you've had.

As one user noted in [customer reviews](https://www.g2.com/products/insightly-crm/reviews): "Insightly stands out from the competition in its integration of project management, allowing users to not only follow clients and contacts but also control tasks and projects in the same application."

### From Lead to Project Delivery

For service-based businesses, this end-to-end visibility is crucial. Marketing agencies can track a lead from initial website inquiry through contract signing to campaign delivery. Consulting firms can see which discovery calls turned into assessments, which assessments became projects, and how those projects performed.

The project management features allow you to track milestones, assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and keep all stakeholders updatedwithout leaving your CRM or losing the client relationship context that got you there.

## How NextPhone + Insightly Integration Works

### Webhook-Based Integration

NextPhone integrates with Insightly through [Insightly's webhook API](https://support.insight.ly/en-us/Knowledge/article/1420/). Webhooks are a method of sending information from one application to another in real-time. When NextPhone handles a call, it immediately sends the call data to Insightly via HTTP POST request.

This approach offers more flexibility than pre-built integrations. You can customize exactly what data gets captured and where it goes in your Insightly workspace.

### What Data Gets Synced

When NextPhone answers a call, here's what automatically syncs to your Insightly CRM:

- Caller name and phone number
- Email address (if collected during the call)
- Call transcript and AI-generated summary
- Custom data fields (project type, budget range, timeline, urgency level)
- Call recording link
- Timestamp and duration

All of this appears in the contact record and activity log within seconds of the call ending. If the caller is an existing contact, their record gets updated. If they're new, NextPhone creates a new contact entry.

### The Client Call Flow

Here's how it works in practice:

1. **Client calls your agency** (even after hours or while you're in a meeting)
2. **NextPhone AI answers in under 5 seconds** with your custom greeting
3. **AI collects project details** through natural conversation (What service are they interested in? What's their timeline? Budget range?)
4. **Data syncs to Insightly** via webhookcontact record created/updated, call logged as activity
5. **Team sees the inquiry** in your CRM dashboard within seconds
6. **Follow-up happens fast** with full context already captured

[Research shows](https://www.openphone.com/blog/crm-phone-integration/) that support teams with instant access to customer history enable first-call resolution and reduce handling times. For project-based businesses, this means your team can follow up on leads with complete context, even if they weren't the ones who took the call.

## 5 Benefits of NextPhone + Insightly Integration

### 1. Never Miss a Client Call

NextPhone answers every call in under 5 seconds, 24/7. When you're presenting to a client, the AI handles the incoming inquiry. When you're on-site delivering a project, the AI captures the next lead. After hours? Covered.

You get intelligent call handling without hiring a full-time receptionist ($35,000/year) or subscribing to expensive answering services ($500-800/month for limited calls).

### 2. Automatic Call Logging

No more manual call notes. No more trying to remember what a caller said. The AI generates a transcript and summary of every conversation, then logs it directly in the contact's Insightly record.

Your team sees exactly who called, when, what they wanted, and what information they providedwithout anyone having to type a single note.

### 3. Project Context at Your Fingertips

Because everything lives in Insightly, you can see call history within project records. When you're planning deliverables, you can reference what the client said in their initial inquiry. When issues arise, you can review conversation history to understand expectations.

This is especially valuable during project handoffs. Your sales team closes the deal, and your delivery team inherits complete contextevery call, every email, every note, all linked to the project.

### 4. 24/7 Client Coverage

Agencies often work with clients across time zones. International inquiries come in at odd hours. Urgent requests arrive on weekends. With [NextPhone](https://getnextphone.com), you're always available.

The AI doesn't just take a messageit asks qualifying questions, collects details about their needs, and can even schedule follow-up meetings on your calendar. Your team arrives Monday morning with qualified leads, not just voicemails.

### 5. Seamless Project Handoff

The sales-to-delivery handoff is where context gets lost in most agencies. With this integration, when an opportunity converts to a project in Insightly, all the call history, transcripts, and client details come along.

Your project managers start with complete knowledge of what was promised, what questions the client asked, and what concerns they raisedbefore the project even begins.

## How NextPhone Helps Agencies Capture Every Client Call

NextPhone is an [AI receptionist](https://getnextphone.com) designed specifically for small businesses that can't afford to miss calls but can't afford full-time reception staff either.

The AI answers every call, engages in natural conversation, collects whatever information your business needs (you customize the questions), and integrates with your existing tools through webhooks. For Insightly users, this means call data flows directly into your CRM without manual data entry.

Here's what sets it apart:

- **Custom data collection:** The AI asks questions specific to your agency (What type of project? What's your timeline? How did you hear about us?)
- **Intelligent routing:** Urgent calls get forwarded to your phone immediately; routine inquiries get handled by AI
- **Unlimited calls:** $199/month regardless of call volume (vs $2,900/month for an in-house receptionist or $500-800/month for traditional answering services with call limits)
- **Integration flexibility:** Works with Insightly and dozens of other tools through HTTP webhooks

One marketing agency uses NextPhone to capture leads during client pitches. The AI collects project scope details, syncs them to Insightly, and the team reviews qualified opportunities in their CRM after meetings wrap up. No calls missed, no manual logging, no lost context.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can NextPhone integrate with Insightly directly?

Yes. NextPhone integrates with Insightly through [Insightly's webhook API](https://support.insight.ly/en-us/Knowledge/article/1420/). When a call is handled, NextPhone sends the call data to your Insightly workspace in real-time via HTTP POST. No pre-built connector is neededit uses custom webhooks, which gives you more control over what data syncs and how it's formatted.

### What call data syncs to Insightly?

Every call automatically syncs the caller's name, phone number, and email (if collected). You also get a full transcript, an AI-generated summary of the conversation, and any custom data fields you configure NextPhone to collect (like project type, budget range, timeline, or urgency level). Finally, a link to the call recording is included in the activity log.

### Does this work for agencies with multiple team members?

Yes. Call data syncs to your shared Insightly workspace, so all team members with appropriate permissions can see call logs, transcripts, and notes. You can also configure NextPhone to route urgent calls to specific team members based on call context or time of day.

### How difficult is setup?

The NextPhone team helps you configure the webhook integration during onboarding. For basic setup (sync call data to contacts and activities), it takes about 30 minutes and requires no coding. If you want advanced customization (routing calls based on project type, syncing to specific custom fields), that may take a bit longer but still doesn't require developer resources.

### How much does this cost?

NextPhone costs $199/month for unlimited calls. Insightly pricing [starts at $29/month per user](https://www.insightly.com/pricing/) for the Plus plan, which includes CRM and project management features.
