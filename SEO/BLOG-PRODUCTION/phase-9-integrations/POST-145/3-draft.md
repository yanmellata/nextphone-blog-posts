Your phone rings at 2 PM. An urgent customer needs emergency plumbing repaira burst pipe flooding their basement. You're under a house fixing another job. The call goes to voicemail. They call the next plumber. You just lost a $4,200 emergency job.

This happens more than you think. In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, that's 31 missed calls. If just 20% would have converted at an average $3,500 project value, you're losing $21,700 per month. That's $260,400 per year in revenue going to your competitors.

[According to industry research](https://emitrr.com/blog/ai-phone-system/), over 70% of companies plan to upgrade to an AI phone system within the next two years. If you have AT&T Business Phone, you have two clear paths to add AI receptionist capabilities. This guide shows you both options with transparent pricing, setup steps, and real data to help you choose.

## What AT&T Business Phone Services Are Available?

Before you can integrate AI, you need to understand which AT&T service you have. AT&T offers two distinct business phone products, and people often confuse them. The integration path you choose depends on which one you're using.

### AT&T Phone for Business (Traditional VoIP)

This is AT&T's basic VoIP service for small businesses. It converts your existing phone lines to digital service over your AT&T Business Internet or Fiber connection.

Pricing starts at $15 per month for the first line (regular price $30/mo). The service includes over 30 calling features like Caller ID, Call Waiting, Call Forwarding, Three-Way Calling, and Voicemail-to-Text. You get unlimited calling in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada.

The advantage here is simplicity. You keep your existing analog phonesno new equipment required. It's NFPA 72 compliant for critical systems and includes 24-hour battery backup.

If you have AT&T Business Internet or Fiber and added phone service through them, you likely have Phone for Business.

### AT&T Office@Hand (Cloud Communication Platform)

Office@Hand is AT&T's comprehensive cloud communications platform, built on [RingCentral's infrastructure](https://www.ringcentral.com/). This is a full unified communications system with video conferencing, team messaging, and advanced call management.

Plans include over 40 advanced features and native mobile apps. The platform supports CRM integrations, analytics, andmost relevant hereAI receptionist capabilities.

Office@Hand is a more expensive, feature-rich solution designed for businesses that need a complete communication ecosystem. If your phone app says "Office@Hand" or you access your phone system through a RingCentral-branded portal, this is what you have.

### Which Service Do You Have?

Check your AT&T Business account online or look at your billing statement. The product name will be listed clearly. If you're still unsure, call AT&T Business Support at 800-321-2000 (MondayFriday, 8 AM7 PM ET).

Why does this matter? Because AT&T's native AI receptionist only works with Office@Hand. But third-party AI solutions work with both services through call forwarding.

## AT&T Office@Hand Native AI Receptionist

If you already have Office@Hand, AT&T offers a native AI receptionist add-on. This is the most integrated option, built directly into your existing platform.

### What Is Office@Hand AI Receptionist?

The [Office@Hand AI Receptionist](https://www.ringcentral.com/us/en/blog/introducing-officehand-ai-receptionist/) uses conversational AI to answer calls 24/7, route inquiries, and handle common questions. It's powered by RingCentral's AI technology and integrates seamlessly with your Office@Hand account.

The system handles custom greetings, answers frequently asked questions based on your business information, transfers calls by name or context, and can send text messages to callers. You train it using your website, FAQs, and uploaded documents.

Setup is straightforward. You choose a professional AI persona, add your business information, and configure common questions. The AI syncs automatically with your existing Office@Hand phone settings.

### Key Features

Here's what Office@Hand AI Receptionist can do:

- **24/7 availability** - Answers every call, even after hours and weekends
- **Intelligent routing** - Transfers calls to the right person based on caller intent
- **CRM integration** - Automatically logs call details and updates contact records
- **Call transcription** - Converts voicemails and calls to searchable text
- **Real-time coaching** - Provides suggested responses during live calls
- **Knowledge base training** - Learns from your website, documents, and FAQs

The system is designed to handle routine inquiries while escalating complex questions to human staff.

### Pricing Structure

Office@Hand AI Receptionist starts at $39 per month for 100 minutes of AI call handling. But there's a catchyou need an Office@Hand base plan to use it.

The base Office@Hand plan costs approximately $70 per month per user. So your total minimum cost is around $109 per month for AI receptionist capabilities.

The 100-minute limit is another consideration. If you receive 42 calls per month (the average for contractors in our study) and each call averages 3-4 minutes, you'll hit the limit quickly. Overage pricing applies for additional minutes.

### Limitations to Consider

Office@Hand AI is integrated and convenient, but it has constraints. The 100-minute starter limit isn't enough for high call volume businesses. You're locked into the Office@Hand ecosystemswitching platforms means losing your AI setup.

Customization options are limited compared to standalone AI receptionist platforms. You get preset personas and configurations rather than fully custom AI behavior. And the total cost adds up when you factor in the required base plan.

## How to Integrate Third-Party AI Receptionists with AT&T

Whether you have AT&T Phone for Business or Office@Hand, you can integrate third-party AI receptionist services using call forwarding. This approach gives you more flexibility and often better pricing for unlimited call handling.

### Why Consider Third-Party AI Solutions?

Third-party AI receptionists work with your existing AT&T phone service without requiring platform changes. You're not locked into AT&T's ecosystem, which means you can switch or upgrade your phone service without losing your AI setup.

Most third-party solutions offer unlimited call minutes rather than per-minute limits. You get more customization optionsthe AI can be trained specifically for your business with custom workflows, integrations, and behavior.

Pricing is often more transparent with flat monthly fees. And you can use the same AI receptionist even if you change phone carriers later.

### How Call Forwarding Integration Works

The setup is simpler than you might think. You forward your AT&T Business Phone number to your AI receptionist's dedicated phone number. When customers call your business, AT&T automatically routes the call to your AI receptionist service.

The AI answers, engages with the caller, collects information, and can transfer calls back to you for complex questions or emergencies. From the caller's perspective, they dialed your business number and got immediate assistance.

No APIs, no complex integrations, no IT team required. Just basic call forwarding that's been around for decades.

### Step-by-Step Setup Process

Here's how to set up third-party AI receptionist integration with AT&T Business Phone:

**Step 1: Choose your AI receptionist service** and sign up for an account. You'll receive a dedicated phone number for call forwarding.

**Step 2: From your AT&T business phone**, dial `*72` (or `72#` on some systems). You should hear a dial tone.

**Step 3: Enter your AI receptionist's forwarding number** exactly as provided. Include the area code even if it's local.

**Step 4: Wait for confirmation.** You'll hear a confirmation tone or message indicating call forwarding is active.

**Step 5: Test the setup** by calling your business number from another phone. You should reach your AI receptionist.

**Step 6: Configure your AI receptionist settings** through your provider's dashboard. Add business information, set up greetings, configure call routing rules, and train the AI on your FAQs.

To deactivate call forwarding later, dial `*73`. To verify if forwarding is active, dial `*74`.

### Compatible Third-Party Solutions

Any AI receptionist service that provides a dedicated phone number for forwarding will work with AT&T Business Phone. Look for services that offer:

- Dedicated forwarding numbers
- 24/7 availability
- Custom training on your business
- Emergency call detection and routing
- CRM integrations
- SMS and email notifications
- Transparent pricing

NextPhone, for example, provides instant AT&T activation codes and dedicated forwarding numbers that work with both AT&T Phone for Business and Office@Hand.

## AT&T AI Receptionist Costs: Native vs Third-Party

Let's break down the real costs with complete transparency. Understanding the total investment helps you make the right decision for your business.

### Office@Hand AI Total Cost

Office@Hand AI Receptionist: $39/mo for 100 minutes of AI call handling

Office@Hand base plan (required): ~$70/mo per user

**Total minimum cost: $109/mo**

But here's what that includes:

- 100 minutes of AI call handling per month
- Full Office@Hand platform access
- Video conferencing and team messaging
- CRM integrations
- Call analytics

If you exceed 100 minutes, overage charges apply. For a contractor receiving 42 calls per month at 3-4 minutes each, you're looking at 126-168 minutes of AI call time. You'll exceed the limit most months.

### Third-Party AI Cost Structure

Third-party AI receptionist services typically charge flat monthly fees for unlimited calls. NextPhone, for example, costs $199 per month with no per-minute limits.

**Total cost: $199/mo for unlimited calls**

What you get:

- Unlimited AI call handling (no minute caps)
- 24/7 availability
- Custom AI training on your business
- Emergency detection and intelligent routing
- CRM integrations via webhooks
- SMS and email notifications
- Works with your existing AT&T phone service (no platform change required)

The higher upfront cost delivers better value for businesses with high call volume. You're not paying for a full UCaaS platform you might not needjust the AI receptionist capability.

### Real Revenue Impact Data

Here's why this investment matters. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, the data reveals a brutal reality about missed calls.

**74.1% of calls went completely unanswered.** For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, that's 31 missed calls going straight to voicemail.

**25.4% of customers explicitly requested callbacks.** That's 11 callback requests per month. Without a systematic tracking system, research shows 80% of callback requests never happen. You lose 9 leads per month just from forgotten callbacks.

**15.9% of calls contained urgency language**words like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP." These are high-value calls. Emergency jobs average $4,200, significantly higher than routine work. Missing just one emergency call per week costs you $16,800 per month.

One customer told us: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

### ROI Calculation Example

Let's calculate the return on investment with conservative numbers.

You receive 42 calls per month (industry average for small contractors). Without AI, 74.1% go unansweredthat's 31 missed calls. If just 20% of those missed calls would have converted at an average $3,500 project value, you're losing $21,700 per month in revenue.

That's $260,400 per year going to competitors who answered the phone.

Now, let's say you invest in an AI receptionist. At $199 per month for unlimited calls, you spend $2,388 per year.

If the AI helps you capture just ONE additional $3,500 job per month, you generate $42,000 in annual revenue from calls you would have missed.

**ROI: $42,000 revenue / $2,388 cost = 17.6x return on investment**

And that's the conservative scenario assuming you only capture one extra job per month. Most contractors see significantly better results.

## NextPhone: AI Receptionist for AT&T Customers

NextPhone is built specifically for small business contractors who need reliable call answering without complex enterprise platforms. It works seamlessly with both AT&T Phone for Business and Office@Hand through simple call forwarding.

### What Makes NextPhone Different

Unlike Office@Hand's minute-limited AI, NextPhone offers unlimited call handling for a flat $199 per month. You're never watching the clock or worrying about overage charges during busy seasons.

The AI is trained specifically on your business. You provide your website, FAQs, service descriptions, and pricing information. NextPhone's AI learns your business deeplynot just generic scripts, but your specific services, policies, and customer answers.

Emergency detection is built-in. When callers use urgency language or describe emergencies, NextPhone routes calls to your phone immediately. You never miss high-value emergency jobs because the AI couldn't detect the urgency.

The system works 24/7 and answers calls in under 5 seconds. No long ring times, no "please hold" messagesjust immediate engagement with potential customers.

### Integration Process

Setting up NextPhone with your AT&T Business Phone takes about 20 minutes:

You sign up for NextPhone and receive your dedicated forwarding number. Set up call forwarding on your AT&T phone using the `*72` code we covered earlier. Configure your NextPhone dashboard with business information, service details, and call routing preferences.

Train the AI by uploading your website URL, FAQs, and any documents about your services. NextPhone's AI analyzes this information and learns how to answer customer questions accurately.

Test the integration by calling your business number. You'll reach NextPhone's AI receptionist, which will engage naturally with callers just like a trained human receptionist would.

### Key Features for AT&T Customers

NextPhone includes capabilities that matter for small business contractors:

**Intelligent call handling** - The AI asks qualifying questions specific to your business. For a plumber, it might ask about the type of issue, property type, and timeline. For an electrician, it asks about the electrical problem and safety concerns.

**Emergency routing** - In our analysis of 13,175 calls, 15.9% contained urgency language. NextPhone detects these calls and transfers immediately to your phone, so you never miss high-value emergency work.

**CRM integrations** - NextPhone automatically pushes lead information to your CRM via webhooks. Customer details are logged in your system within seconds of the call ending, not hours later when someone "gets around to it."

**SMS follow-ups** - The AI can send text messages to callers after the call with booking links, service information, or confirmation details.

**Email notifications** - You receive email summaries of every call with the caller's information, call summary, and links to recordings and transcripts.

**Call recordings and transcripts** - Every call is recorded and transcribed. You can review how the AI handled calls and improve training based on real conversations.

The system uses the hybrid approach we recommend: AI handles routine questions (hours, pricing, scheduling) while transferring complex or unusual inquiries to you. This ensures callers always get the right answer.

## Common Setup Issues and Solutions

Most AT&T call forwarding setups work smoothly, but here are the issues you might encounter and how to fix them.

### Call Forwarding Not Working

If you dial `*72` and nothing happens, try `72#` instead. AT&T uses both codes depending on your specific service type and region.

Verify your business plan includes call forwarding. Most AT&T Business plans include it, but some basic plans don't. Check your plan features in your online account or call 800-321-2000 to verify.

Make sure you're dialing the forwarding number correctly with the area code. Even if the forwarding number is local, include all 10 digits.

Wait for the confirmation tone. Some systems take 5-10 seconds to activate. If you hang up before confirmation, forwarding won't activate.

### Number Compatibility Issues

Toll-free numbers (800, 888, 877, etc.) can sometimes have different forwarding procedures. If you're forwarding a toll-free AT&T business number, contact AT&T support directly at 800-321-2000 for specific instructions.

Ported numbers occasionally have restrictions if you recently transferred your number to AT&T. The porting process can take a few days to fully complete. If you just switched to AT&T, wait 3-5 business days before setting up call forwarding.

### Getting Help from AT&T

AT&T Business Support is available at 800-321-2000 (MondayFriday, 8 AM7 PM ET). Have your account number ready when you call.

For Office@Hand technical support, call 877-219-3898. They can help with platform-specific questions about AI receptionist setup or call routing.

Online support documentation is available at [AT&T Business Support](https://www.business.att.com/support.html) with guides for call forwarding and feature management.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use third-party AI with AT&T Phone for Business?

Yes. Third-party AI receptionists work with any AT&T business phone service through call forwarding. You don't need to upgrade to Office@Hand or change your current AT&T plan. Just activate call forwarding using `*72` and forward calls to your AI receptionist's dedicated number. The setup works with AT&T Phone for Business, Office@Hand, and even traditional landlines.

### Do I need Office@Hand to use AI receptionist?

No. Office@Hand is only required if you want to use AT&T's native AI receptionist add-on. Third-party AI receptionist services like NextPhone work with any AT&T phone service through simple call forwarding. You can keep your current AT&T Phone for Business plan and add AI capabilities without platform changes.

### Will call forwarding cost extra?

Most AT&T Business plans include call forwarding as a standard feature at no additional charge. Check your specific plan by logging into your AT&T Business account online or calling 800-321-2000. There are typically no per-call forwarding fees on business plansyou just pay your regular monthly phone service cost plus your AI receptionist service fee.

### Can I forward only after hours or when busy?

Yes. AT&T supports conditional call forwarding, allowing you to forward calls only in specific situations. You can set your AI receptionist to handle calls only during certain hours, or only when your line is busy or unanswered. Many AI receptionist services, including NextPhone, let you configure business hours in their dashboard. Calls during business hours can ring your phone first, with the AI answering only if you don't pick up within a few rings.

### What happens if the AI can't answer a question?

The best AI receptionists use a hybrid approachthey handle routine questions and transfer complex inquiries to a human. NextPhone, for example, transfers calls mid-conversation when it encounters questions outside its training. The caller experiences a smooth handoff: "Let me connect you with someone who can help with that specific question." This ensures customers always get accurate information rather than the AI guessing or providing wrong answers.

### How long does setup take?

Setup time depends on which path you choose. If you already have AT&T Office@Hand, adding the native AI receptionist takes about 10-15 minutesyou configure it through your existing Office@Hand dashboard. For third-party AI via call forwarding, expect about 20-30 minutes total. This includes activating call forwarding on your AT&T line (5 minutes) and configuring your AI receptionist settings (15-25 minutes). Training the AI on your business information adds another 10-15 minutes, but you can refine this over time.

### Can I try before committing?

For AT&T Office@Hand AI, contact AT&T sales at 877-219-3898 to inquire about trial options. Third-party services often offer more flexible trials. NextPhone provides a 14-day free trial with no credit card required, allowing you to test the system with real calls before deciding. You can set up call forwarding temporarily during the trial, then deactivate it if you choose not to continue.

## Choose the Right AI Receptionist for Your AT&T Phone System

You have two clear paths to add AI receptionist capabilities to your AT&T Business Phone.

AT&T Office@Hand AI costs $109 per month total (including required base plan) and integrates natively with the Office@Hand platform. It's best if you already use Office@Hand for video conferencing, team messaging, and unified communications. The 100-minute limit works for very low call volume businesses.

Third-party AI receptionists like NextPhone cost $199 per month for unlimited calls and work with any AT&T phone service through call forwarding. This path offers more flexibility, unlimited call handling, and works whether you have Phone for Business or Office@Hand. Setup takes under 30 minutes with no technical expertise required.

The data from our 7-month study of 13,175 calls is clear: 74.1% of calls go unanswered without AI, costing the average contractor $260,400 per year in lost revenue. Both solutions pay for themselves if they help you capture just one additional job per month.

For most small business contractors, the flexibility and unlimited calls of a third-party AI like NextPhone outweigh the convenience of Office@Hand's native integration. You're not locked into a specific platform, you never hit minute limits during busy seasons, and you get more customization for your specific business needs.

Stop missing calls. Stop losing revenue to competitors who answer faster. Start your free 14-day trial of NextPhone today and see how it works with your AT&T Business Phone system.
