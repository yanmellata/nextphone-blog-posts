## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 25.4% of callers request callbacks ’ Use in: Email follow-up automation section
- 15.9% of calls contain urgency language ’ Use in: Segmentation/tagging section
- 6.9% are quote/estimate requests ’ Use in: Lead nurturing workflow section
- 74.1% of calls go unanswered (without AI) ’ Use in: Problem statement intro

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data" ’ Use in: Problem introduction
2. Reference towing companies and contractors who need follow-up systems ’ Use in: Use cases

**Industry Examples:**
- **Contractors:** 42 calls/mo average, need systematic follow-up for quote requests (6.9% of calls)
- **Service businesses:** Emergency calls (15.9%) need different email sequences than routine inquiries
- **Real estate:** High intent calls benefit from immediate automated email with property details

**ROI Calculations:**
- Without automated follow-up: 25.4% of callers requesting callbacks get forgotten
- If 11 callback requests/month × 30% conversion × $3,500 average = $11,550/month lost
- Email automation captures these leads automatically
- Conversion lift: Businesses using email + phone see 3X more lead capture

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks. Without an automated system, most of these callback requests fall through the cracks."
