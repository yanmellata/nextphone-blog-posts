**Purpose:** Transparent pricing breakdown, show value vs alternatives, prove ROI

**Word Count Target:** 400-450 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Zapier Pricing Breakdown
2. Total Cost: AI Receptionist + Zapier
3. ROI Calculation: What You'll Recover

**Key Points to Cover:**

**Zapier Pricing:**
- Free: 100 tasks/month (good for testing, not production)
- Professional: $29.99/month (750 tasks) - recommended for most small businesses
- Team: $69/month (2,000 tasks) - for growing teams
- Enterprise: Custom pricing (high volume)
- Task definition: Each action counts (CRM creation = 1 task, Slack message = 1 task)
- Multi-step Zaps: 1 trigger + 3 actions = 3 tasks per call
- Estimation: 50 calls/month × 3 actions = 150 tasks = fits in Professional plan
- Annual billing: Save ~33%

**NextPhone + Zapier Total:**
- NextPhone: $199/month (unlimited calls, AI receptionist, integrations)
- Zapier Professional: $29.99/month (750 tasks)
- Total: $228.99/month

**Compare to Alternatives:**
- Traditional receptionist: $35,000/year = $2,900/month (only works 9-5, vacations, sick days)
- Live answering service (Smith.ai): $500+/month (limited calls, per-call fees, no automation)
- Savings: $2,900 - $228.99 = $2,671/month = $32,052/year saved

**ROI Calculation:**
- Current state: 42 calls/month, miss 31 (74.1%)
- Conversion: 20% of answered calls convert
- Average job: $3,500
- Lost revenue: 31 missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 = $21,700/month
- With automation: Capture those 31 calls
- Recovered: $21,700/month = $260,400/year
- Investment: $228.99/month = $2,748/year
- ROI: ($260,400 - $2,748) / $2,748 = 9,374% ROI
