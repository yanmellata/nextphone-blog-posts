### SECTION 1: Why Service Businesses on Squarespace Need More Than a Website

**Purpose:** Establish the problem specific to service businesses
**Word Count Target:** 150-200 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Squarespace Is Popular with Service Businesses
2. But a Great Website Doesn't Answer Calls

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Squarespace is perfect for contractors/trades: easy to manage, looks professional, no tech hassle
- Common setup: nice template, photos of work, contact form, phone number
- Problem: You're a one-person operation or small crew—can't answer while working
- When you're under a house fixing pipes or on a roof, phone in truck
- Customers don't leave voicemails, they call next contractor

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat:** "Squarespace 7.1 is commonly used for trade websites" - Source: External (cite Whatsquare.space)
- **Stat:** "74.1% of calls to home services businesses go completely unanswered" - Source: NextPhone factbase (13,175 calls, 47 customers, 7 months)

**Examples/Quotes:**

**Purpose:** Explain why simple solutions are incomplete
**Word Count Target:** 150-175 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. What Click-to-Call Buttons Actually Do
2. The Missing Piece: Someone Still Has to Answer

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Most Squarespace integration guides show how to add click-to-call button
- Button uses tel: protocol—taps on mobile dial your number
- This is helpful for customer (easy to dial) but doesn't solve YOUR problem
- Button still requires YOU to answer the phone
- If you're on job site, call goes to voicemail
- "30% increase in call volume" means nothing if 74.1% still unanswered

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat:** "Studies show businesses using Click to Dial can see 30% increase in call volume" - Source: Elfsight
- **Counter-stat:** "But 74.1% still go unanswered" - NextPhone data

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Click-to-call button on beautiful Squarespace site, contractor in crawl space, call missed
- Analogy: "A call button is like a doorbell—it only works if someone's home to answer"

**Visual Needed:**

- AI captures name, phone, email, details—logs everything
- For emergencies (15.9% of calls), AI routes immediately to your phone
- For quotes/scheduling, AI collects info and you follow up when available
- Works after hours, weekends, during busy season surges

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat:** "AI answers in under 5 seconds" - Product capability
- **Stat:** "15.9% of calls contain urgency language" - NextPhone factbase

**Purpose:** Show ROI to justify investment
**Word Count Target:** 175-200 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. What Click-to-Call Buttons Cost (vs What They Don't Deliver)
2. What Missed Calls Cost You
3. What NextPhone Costs (and What You Gain)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Basic click-to-call widgets: Free to $10/month—but don't answer calls
- Traditional answering service: $500-800/month, limited hours, script-driven
- In-house receptionist: $35,000/year ($2,900/month), only 9-5, sick days
- Your current cost: MISSED CALLS
  - 42 calls/month × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
  - If 20% convert at $3,500 average = $21,700/month lost
  - That's $260,400 per year in lost revenue
- NextPhone: $199/month unlimited calls
  - Pays for itself if it captures just ONE $3,500 job per month
  - ROI: Capture 6 extra jobs/year = $21,000 revenue for $2,388 investment

**Data/Stats to Include:**
