**Data/Stats to Include:**

### FAQ SECTION

**Purpose:** Answer remaining objections and questions
**Word Count Target:** 400-450 words (7 questions)

**FAQ Questions:**

### FAQ #1: Will I lose my phone number when leaving Grasshopper?

**Answer Outline:**
No, you have the legal right to keep your phone number under FCC regulations. The porting process transfers your existing Grasshopper number to NextPhone. As long as you provide correct documentation and keep your Grasshopper account active during the transfer, your number ports successfully in 5-10 business days.

**Link:** Internal link to "How porting works" guide

---

### FAQ #2: How long will I be without phone service?

**Answer Outline:**
There's no downtime. Your Grasshopper number continues working normally until the exact moment the port completes. The switch happens instantly (usually early morning) - one minute calls go to Grasshopper, the next minute they go to NextPhone. You can also set up call forwarding as a backup during the transition period.

**Link:** None

---

### FAQ #3: What happens to my voicemails and text messages?

**Answer Outline:**
Critical: Grasshopper deletes your SMS message history immediately after porting and doesn't provide an export option. Before you start the migration, screenshot important text conversations and manually save any contacts or information you need. Voicemails can be saved by playing them and recording to your computer or phone.

**Link:** None

---

### FAQ #4: Can AI really handle calls as well as a human?

**Answer Outline:**
Modern AI receptionists achieve 85-95% accuracy for routine inquiries like hours, pricing, and scheduling. The key is training the AI on your specific business. In our analysis of 13,175 calls, customers often preferred the AI receptionist over low-quality human answering services because it answers faster (under 5 seconds), stays consistent, and never misses a call due to being busy or after-hours.

**Link:** Internal link to "AI vs Human Receptionist" comparison post

---

### FAQ #5: How much does NextPhone cost compared to Grasshopper?

**Answer Outline:**
Grasshopper advertises $14-25/month but most users pay $60-100/month after adding extensions and features (or $245+/month with live receptionist add-on). NextPhone is $199/month unlimited with no per-call fees, no per-minute charges, and all features included (AI answering, CRM integration, call recording, emergency routing, 24/7 coverage). Factor in recovered revenue from captured calls and the ROI is significant.

**Link:** Internal link to NextPhone pricing page

---

### FAQ #6: Do I need to cancel Grasshopper before porting?

**Answer Outline:**
No - don't cancel until AFTER the port is 100% complete. Your Grasshopper account must remain active for the porting process to work. Cancel too early and the port will fail, requiring you to restart the entire process. Once NextPhone confirms the port is complete and you've tested incoming calls successfully, then you can safely cancel Grasshopper.

**Link:** None

---

### FAQ #7: What if I have multiple numbers with Grasshopper?

**Answer Outline:**
You can port all your Grasshopper numbers (local, toll-free, etc.) to NextPhone in a single request. Just list all numbers on the Letter of Authorization. Note that Grasshopper doesn't allow international number porting - only US and Canadian numbers can transfer. The same timeline applies regardless of how many numbers you're porting.
