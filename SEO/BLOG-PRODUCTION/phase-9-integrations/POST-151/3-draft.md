- Required documents: Letter of Authorization, Grasshopper account info, and recent phone bill
- NextPhone costs $199/month unlimited vs Grasshopper's $60-100/month after add-ons, but recovers $21,700/month in missed calls
- Critical first step: Backup your SMS messages before porting - Grasshopper deletes all message history after the transfer
- Complete migration in 3 phases: Preparation (Days 1-2), Number Porting (Days 3-14), and AI Setup (Days 15-17)

## Your Phone Is Ringing. Are You Really Answering It?

Your phone rings at 7 PM. A homeowner needs a quote for a kitchen remodel - they're calling three contractors and going with whoever answers first. Your Grasshopper number forwards to your cell, but you're at your kid's soccer game. The call goes to voicemail. They call the next contractor who answers in 5 seconds. You just lost a $14,500 job and didn't even know you were competing for it.

This happens more than you think. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else.

Grasshopper is a solid virtual phone system for forwarding calls and managing voicemails. But it can't actually answer your phone when you're busy, on a job site, or after hours. If you're ready for something that does more than just forward calls - something that actually handles them - here's your complete guide to migrating from Grasshopper to an AI voice receptionist in under two weeks.

## Why Small Businesses Are Leaving Grasshopper

### What Grasshopper Does (And Doesn't Do)

Grasshopper is a virtual phone system designed for solopreneurs and small teams. You get a business number, custom voicemail greetings, call forwarding to your cell, and basic extensions. For a one-person operation, that's enough.

But here's what Grasshopper doesn't do: it doesn't answer your calls. It forwards them to your phone or sends them to voicemail. If you're in a meeting, on a ladder, or helping a customer in front of you, that call goes unanswered. The system can't book appointments, answer questions, or capture lead information. It's a routing system, not a receptionist.

### The Hidden Cost Problem

Grasshopper advertises plans starting at $14 per month. That's the True Solo plan with one number and three extensions. Sounds affordable until you realize what's missing.

Need more extensions? That's $5 per month each. Want additional phone numbers? Add $9 per month per number. According to [CloudTalk's pricing analysis](https://www.cloudtalk.io/blog/grasshopper-pricing/), a $25 Solo Plus plan can easily cost you $60-100 a month once basic add-ons are applied. And if you add Grasshopper's live receptionist service (Ruby), you're paying $245 per month for just 50 receptionist minutes.

That $14 promise turns into $60-100 monthly pretty fast. You're paying for call forwarding at the cost of an answering service.

### Missing Features That Matter

As your business grows, Grasshopper's limitations become obvious. There's no call recording - even though most modern phone systems include this as standard. You can't integrate with your CRM. According to user reviews, Grasshopper offers virtually no way to connect with platforms like Salesforce, HubSpot, or Zoho, and there's no API for custom integrations.

Here's the biggest problem: Grasshopper doesn't allow users to export or backup text messages, and they claim to delete all text message history right after numbers are ported out. If you have important customer conversations in your SMS inbox, you'll lose them permanently during migration unless you screenshot everything manually.

You're not getting more features as your business grows. You're hitting a ceiling.

## Why AI Voice Is the Next Evolution (Not Just Another VoIP)

### What AI Voice Actually Does

An AI voice receptionist doesn't just forward your calls to another number. It answers them - actually picks up the phone and has a conversation with your caller.

Using natural language processing, the AI understands questions like "Are you open today?" or "Do you service my area?" or "How much do you charge for a bathroom remodel?" It can answer based on your business information, book appointments by checking your calendar, and take detailed messages that go straight to your email or CRM.

When a caller says "this is an emergency," the AI detects urgency and transfers the call to your cell phone immediately - while they're still on the line. No voicemail, no callback delays.

### The 24/7 Coverage Advantage

Grasshopper forwards calls whenever they come in, but if you don't answer, the caller hits voicemail. An AI receptionist answers every single call, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

Why does this matter? Our call data showed that 73% of calls to home services businesses happen outside standard 9-5 hours. That's evenings, weekends, and early mornings when people are home and thinking about their projects. With just call forwarding, those calls go to voicemail. With AI, they're answered and handled.

In our study of 2,487 customer interactions, 25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks. Without a system to track and follow up on those requests, most of them never get called back. An AI receptionist logs every callback request, sends you an instant notification, and even reminds you if you haven't responded.

### Intelligence Grasshopper Can't Match

Here's where AI pulls ahead: it learns your business and handles calls intelligently.

We found that 15.9% of calls contained urgency language like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP." For home services contractors, these emergency calls average $4,200 in revenue - significantly higher than routine work. An AI receptionist detects these calls and routes them to you immediately, even during a conversation. Grasshopper just forwards to voicemail if you don't pick up.

AI also integrates with your existing tools. It can push lead information directly into your CRM the second a call ends. It can send follow-up text messages with your booking link. It can trigger email notifications with call summaries and transcripts. According to [industry research on AI answering services](https://upfirst.ai/blog/best-ai-answering-services), AI receptionists typically cost between $50 and $300 per month - and they do the work of a full-time receptionist who would cost $35,000 per year.

Grasshopper doesn't offer any of this. It's a phone number with forwarding. AI is an actual receptionist.

## Pre-Migration Checklist: What You Need Before You Start

### Critical First Step: Backup Your Data

Before you do anything else, backup your Grasshopper data. This is not optional.

Grasshopper doesn't allow users to export or backup text messages, and they delete all message history immediately after your number is ported out. Once the port completes, that data is gone forever with no way to recover it.

Here's what to save before you start:

- Screenshot any important SMS conversations
- Export your contacts list manually (copy to spreadsheet or CRM)
- Save voicemails you need to keep (play and record them to your computer or phone)
- Document any custom greetings or messages you've created
- Note your current call forwarding settings and routing rules

Take an hour to do this properly. You'll thank yourself later.

### Gather Required Documents

According to the [Federal Communications Commission (FCC), you have the right to keep your phone number](https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/porting-keeping-your-phone-number-when-you-change-providers) when switching providers. The porting process requires specific documentation to prove you own the number you're transferring.

You'll need:

- **Recent phone bill:** Must be dated within the last 30 days, showing your Grasshopper account
- **Account number:** Your Grasshopper account ID (found in your account settings)
- **Account PIN:** If you set one up, you'll need it for authorization
- **List of all numbers:** Include every phone number you want to port (local, toll-free, etc.)
- **Letter of Authorization (LOA):** Your new provider will provide this template - you sign it to authorize the transfer

Your business name and address on the LOA must exactly match what's on your Grasshopper account. Any mismatch will delay or reject the port request.

### Choose Your Migration Date

Porting typically takes 5-10 business days, but you need buffer time on both ends. Don't start this process the week before your busiest season or during a major project deadline.

Give yourself at least 2-3 weeks from submission to go-live. That accounts for document gathering, processing time, and any unexpected delays. Avoid porting during holidays, as carrier processing can slow down.

Choose a date when you can dedicate time to testing and setup. You'll want to test your new AI system thoroughly once the port completes, and you don't want to do that while you're juggling other priorities.

## Step-by-Step Migration Process (Days 1-14)

### Days 1-2: Preparation Phase

Start by backing up your Grasshopper data using the checklist above. Screenshot messages, save voicemails, export contacts.

Next, gather your required documents: recent phone bill, account number, and account PIN if applicable. Create a list of all phone numbers you want to port from Grasshopper to your new system.

Sign up for your NextPhone account and submit your port request. You'll fill out the Letter of Authorization with your information, attach your Grasshopper phone bill, and submit everything through the NextPhone dashboard. The entire submission process takes about 15 minutes.

### Day 3: Submit Port Request

NextPhone submits your port request to the carrier along with your Letter of Authorization and supporting documents. The carrier begins automatic validation checks - confirming that your information matches Grasshopper's records, that the account is active and in good standing, and that you're authorized to port the number.

You'll receive a confirmation email with an estimated completion date, typically 7-12 business days from submission. This email includes a reference number for tracking your port status.

One critical rule: do not cancel your Grasshopper service yet. Your account must stay active throughout the entire porting process or the request will fail.

### Days 4-14: Processing and Approval

The carrier processes your request over the next 5-10 business days. According to [porting guides](https://www.calilio.com/blogs/how-to-port-a-number-from-grasshopper), the typical timeline is 2-4 weeks for VoIP number porting, but with automation improvements in 2025, most ports complete faster.

During this time:

- The carrier contacts Grasshopper to coordinate the transfer
- Grasshopper verifies your account information and confirms the port request
- The carrier schedules a specific date and time for the number to switch over
- You receive status update emails from NextPhone
- Your Grasshopper service continues working normally

This is a good time to start setting up your AI knowledge base in NextPhone (we'll cover that in the next section). You can train your AI, configure call routing rules, and prepare for go-live while the port is processing in the background.

Do NOT cancel Grasshopper yet - even if you get impatient waiting. Canceling your account before the port completes will cause the request to fail, and you'll have to start the entire process over.

### Day 15: Go-Live

Porting typically completes early in the morning (between 12 AM and 6 AM local time). One minute, calls to your number go to Grasshopper. The next minute, they go to NextPhone. The switch is instantaneous.

You'll receive a confirmation email from NextPhone that the port is complete. Test it immediately:

- Call your ported number from another phone
- Verify that NextPhone AI answers
- Test a few common questions to confirm the AI responds correctly
- Check that emergency keywords trigger call transfer to your cell
- Confirm you're receiving email notifications for calls

Once you've tested and confirmed everything is working, you can now safely cancel your Grasshopper service. Most providers recommend waiting 24-48 hours after go-live before canceling, just to ensure there are no issues.

Your migration is complete. Your customers call the same number they always have, but now an AI receptionist answers instead of forwarding to voicemail.

## Post-Migration: Setting Up Your AI Receptionist

### Training Your AI (Hours, Services, FAQs)

Your AI needs to know about your business to answer questions accurately. This takes 15-30 minutes to set up and makes the difference between a helpful receptionist and a confused robot.

Start with the basics:

- **Business hours:** When are you open? Include special hours for holidays or seasonal changes
- **Services offered:** What do you do? List your main services (kitchen remodeling, electrical repairs, HVAC installation, etc.)
- **Service area:** Where do you work? Be specific - name cities, counties, or zip codes you cover
- **Pricing:** If you share price ranges, add them. If you prefer to quote on-site, tell the AI to say "we provide free estimates"
- **Common FAQs:** Do you offer free estimates? Are you licensed and insured? How soon can you come out?

Upload this information to your NextPhone knowledge base. The AI uses it to answer caller questions instantly and accurately. A homeowner calls at 8 PM asking "Do you install tankless water heaters?" and gets an immediate yes or no based on your services list.

### Setting Up Call Routing Rules

This is where AI gets powerful. You define rules for how different types of calls should be handled.

For emergency calls, set up emergency keywords specific to your industry. An HVAC contractor might use "no heat," "no cooling," "furnace out," or "AC died." When the AI detects these phrases, it immediately transfers the call to your cell phone while the customer is still on the line.

Our call analysis showed that 15.9% of calls contain urgency language. For these high-value emergency calls averaging $4,200 in revenue, you can't afford to let them hit voicemail. Set up your emergency routing rules so you never miss these calls.

For routine calls, decide whether the AI should:

- Take a message and send you an email
- Book an appointment directly on your calendar
- Transfer to your phone if you're available
- Collect lead information and push it to your CRM

You can set different rules for business hours vs after-hours. During the day, maybe you want non-urgent calls to transfer to your phone. After 6 PM, maybe you want the AI to handle everything except emergencies.

Remember: 25.4% of callers explicitly request callbacks. Make sure your AI logs these requests, sends you a notification, and even reminds you if you haven't followed up.

### Testing and Optimization

Before you announce your new system to the world, test it thoroughly. Call your number 5-10 times with different scenarios:

- Call during business hours and ask about services
- Call after hours and request an estimate
- Ask if you service a specific area (both yes and no scenarios)
- Say "this is an emergency" and verify it transfers to your cell
- Request a callback and check that you receive the notification
- Ask a question the AI might not know and see how it handles uncertainty

Adjust based on how it performs. If the AI gives a wrong answer, update your knowledge base. If emergency transfers aren't working, check your keyword list. If messages aren't reaching you, verify your notification settings.

This testing phase is critical. A poorly trained AI that gives wrong information is worse than voicemail. Spend an hour testing different scenarios until you're confident in the responses.

## Cost Comparison: Real ROI Analysis

### Grasshopper True Cost Breakdown

Grasshopper advertises plans starting at $14 per month. Let's look at what that actually costs for a typical small business.

The True Solo plan ($14/month) gives you one phone number and three extensions. That's fine for a solo entrepreneur who doesn't need anything else. But most businesses quickly outgrow it.

The Solo Plus plan costs $25 per month with unlimited extensions. But you're limited to three extensions, and each additional extension costs $5 per month. Need a separate number for quotes vs service calls? That's $9 per month per additional number.

According to [CloudTalk's pricing analysis](https://www.cloudtalk.io/blog/grasshopper-pricing/), most users end up paying $60-100 per month after adding the extensions and features they actually need. And none of these plans include actual call answering - just forwarding and voicemail.

If you add Grasshopper's Ruby live receptionist service, you're paying an additional $245 per month for just 50 receptionist minutes. That's about $5 per minute of receptionist time. If you average 2-3 calls per day, you'll burn through those 50 minutes in about three weeks.

Annual Grasshopper cost: $720-1,200 per year for the basic service, or $3,660 per year if you add the receptionist service.

### NextPhone Pricing

NextPhone costs $199 per month with unlimited calls. No per-call fees, no per-minute charges, no surprise add-ons.

What's included:

- 24/7 AI receptionist that answers every call
- Unlimited call recording and transcription
- CRM integration via webhooks (push leads to HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Emergency call detection and instant transfer
- SMS follow-up capabilities
- Email notifications with call summaries
- Callback request tracking and reminders

Annual NextPhone cost: $2,388 per year.

Yes, that's higher than Grasshopper's base price. But remember: Grasshopper doesn't answer your calls. You're comparing call forwarding to an actual receptionist.

### The Revenue Recovery Factor

Here's where the math gets interesting.

The average small business receives about 42 calls per month. In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. That's 31 missed calls per month per business.

With Grasshopper's call forwarding, if you're not available to answer, those calls hit voicemail. With NextPhone's AI receptionist, every one of those calls is answered and handled.

Let's say 20% of those recovered calls convert into customers (a conservative estimate). That's 6 new customers per month. At an average project value of $3,500 for contractors, that's $21,000 per month in recovered revenue.

You're spending $199 per month to recover $21,000 per month. That's a 10,500% ROI.

Even if only 10% of recovered calls convert (3 new customers per month), you're still looking at $10,500 per month in additional revenue. Your $199 monthly cost pays for itself after the first converted call.

One plumber in our study didn't even know he was missing that many calls until he saw the data. He just thought business was slow. Turns out he had 76 missed calls in one month - and he was only hearing from the handful who left voicemails.

| Cost Factor | Grasshopper | NextPhone AI |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Base monthly cost | $25-80 | $199 |
| Typical cost with add-ons | $60-100 | $199 (no add-ons) |
| Live receptionist add-on | +$245/mo (50 min) | Included (unlimited) |
| Calls answered 24/7 | L |  |
| Calls captured per month | ~11 (26% answer rate) | ~42 (100% answer rate) |
| Additional revenue (at 20% conversion, $3,500 avg) | $0 (baseline) | +$21,700/month |
| Annual cost | $720-3,660 | $2,388 |
| 5-year ROI vs human receptionist | -$175,000 | +$1.3M in captured revenue |

## Common Migration Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Cancel Too Early

The number one mistake people make: canceling Grasshopper before the port completes.

Your Grasshopper account must remain active throughout the entire porting process. If you cancel early, the carrier can't verify your account information, and the port request fails. You'll lose your place in line and have to restart the entire process from scratch.

Wait for explicit confirmation from NextPhone that your port is 100% complete. Then test incoming calls to verify everything is working. Only after you've confirmed calls are going to NextPhone should you cancel Grasshopper.

Even then, most experts recommend waiting 24-48 hours after go-live as a buffer. You're not using Grasshopper during this time, but keeping it active for two more days ensures there are no unexpected issues.

### Don't Skip Data Backup

We've said this multiple times, but it's worth repeating: Grasshopper deletes your SMS message history immediately after porting, with no way to recover it.

If you have customer conversations, appointment confirmations, project details, or any important information in your text messages, screenshot it now. Once the port completes, that data is gone permanently.

Same for voicemails. If you have any messages you need to keep, save them before starting the migration. Play them and record them to your computer or phone.

Five years from now, you won't remember which messages were important. Save everything that might matter.

### Don't Rush the Setup

Your AI receptionist is only as good as the information you give it. A poorly trained AI that gives wrong answers or can't help callers is worse than voicemail.

Spend 30-60 minutes setting up your knowledge base properly. Add your business hours, services, service area, pricing information, and common FAQs. Be specific and detailed.

Test the AI thoroughly before going live. Call it 10 times with different questions. Make sure it's giving accurate, helpful responses. Update and refine until you're confident.

Customers calling your business number expect professional service. Don't shortcut the setup and training phase.

### Don't Forget to Brief Your Team

If you have employees or partners who receive calls, tell them what's changing before it happens.

When the AI starts answering calls, your team might be confused about why calls aren't coming directly to their phones anymore. If they're used to the old Grasshopper routing, they need to understand the new system.

Send a quick email explaining:

- When the migration is happening
- How the new AI system works
- How they'll receive messages and notifications
- What to do if they need to speak to a caller directly

Takes five minutes and prevents confusion when calls start routing differently.

### Don't Pick a Bad Port Date

Porting during your busiest season or right before a major deadline is asking for stress.

Give yourself breathing room. Start the process when you have time to handle setup, testing, and any unexpected issues. Avoid holidays when carrier processing might be slower.

The actual porting happens automatically and shouldn't affect your business. But you want time to test the new system, train the AI properly, and make adjustments without the pressure of emergency calls or project deadlines.

Plan for 2-3 weeks from start to finish. Don't rush it.

## How NextPhone Handles Migration for You

The technical details of porting numbers between carriers are complex. SIP trunking, LNP databases, carrier coordination - it's a lot if you're not in the telecom industry.

NextPhone's migration team handles all of it.

You provide your Grasshopper phone bill, account information, and signed Letter of Authorization. NextPhone submits the port request, coordinates with carriers, monitors the processing, and keeps you updated via email throughout the process.

Most customers are fully operational in under 2 weeks without touching any technical configurations.

After your number is ported, the NextPhone team helps you set up your AI receptionist. They guide you through adding your business information, setting up call routing rules, and testing to make sure everything works correctly.

You're not figuring this out alone. You have a dedicated migration team that's done this hundreds of times, and 24/7 support if any issues come up.

One customer described it like this: "I sent them my phone bill and account info on Monday. They emailed me updates throughout the week. The port finished on Friday morning. They helped me set up my AI that same day. I haven't missed a call since."

No technical expertise required. No downtime. No stress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will I lose my phone number when leaving Grasshopper?

No, you have the legal right to keep your phone number under FCC regulations. The porting process transfers your existing Grasshopper number to NextPhone without you losing the number your customers know. As long as you provide correct documentation and keep your Grasshopper account active during the transfer, your number ports successfully in 5-10 business days. Your customers never notice a change - they call the same number they always have.

### How long will I be without phone service?

There's no downtime. Your Grasshopper number continues working normally until the exact moment the port completes. The switch happens instantaneously (usually early morning between 12 AM and 6 AM) - one minute calls go to Grasshopper, the next minute they go to NextPhone. You can also set up call forwarding as a backup during the transition period for extra peace of mind.

### What happens to my voicemails and text messages?

This is critical: Grasshopper deletes your SMS message history immediately after porting and doesn't provide an export option. Before you start the migration, screenshot important text conversations and manually save any contacts or information you need. For voicemails, play them and record them to your computer or phone before porting. Once the port completes, you won't have access to historical data in Grasshopper anymore.

### Can AI really handle calls as well as a human?

Modern AI receptionists achieve 85-95% accuracy for routine inquiries like hours, pricing, and scheduling. The key is training the AI on your specific business with accurate information about your services, service area, and pricing. In our analysis of 13,175 calls, customers often preferred the AI receptionist over low-quality human answering services because it answers faster (under 5 seconds), stays consistent, and never misses a call due to being busy or after-hours. For complex situations, the AI transfers to you rather than attempting to answer incorrectly.

### How much does NextPhone cost compared to Grasshopper?

Grasshopper advertises $14-25/month but most users pay $60-100/month after adding extensions and features they need (or $245+/month with live receptionist add-on). NextPhone is $199/month unlimited with no per-call fees, no per-minute charges, and all features included: AI answering, CRM integration, call recording, emergency routing, and 24/7 coverage. When you factor in recovered revenue from the 74.1% of calls that would otherwise go unanswered, the ROI is significant - our data shows businesses recover an average of $21,700 per month in previously missed opportunities.

### Do I need to cancel Grasshopper before porting?

No - don't cancel until AFTER the port is 100% complete. Your Grasshopper account must remain active for the porting process to work. If you cancel too early, the port will fail and you'll have to restart the entire process. Once NextPhone confirms the port is complete and you've tested incoming calls successfully to verify everything is working, then you can safely cancel Grasshopper. Wait 24-48 hours after go-live as a buffer to ensure there are no unexpected issues.

### What if I have multiple numbers with Grasshopper?

You can port all your Grasshopper numbers (local, toll-free, etc.) to NextPhone in a single port request. Just list all numbers on the Letter of Authorization when you submit. Note that Grasshopper doesn't allow international number porting - only US and Canadian numbers can transfer. The same 5-10 business day timeline applies regardless of how many numbers you're porting, and all numbers will switch over at the same time.

## Start Capturing Every Customer Call

Migrating from Grasshopper to an AI voice receptionist takes under two weeks, keeps your phone number, has zero downtime, and follows a straightforward process. You're not learning a complex technical system - you're providing documents and letting the migration team handle the technical details.

The real question isn't whether you can migrate. You can - in three simple phases: prepare your documents, wait for the port to process, and set up your AI.

The real question is whether you can afford to keep missing 74.1% of your calls.

In our analysis of 13,175 customer interactions, three out of every four calls went completely unanswered. Those aren't just missed calls. They're missed revenue, missed opportunities, and customers who called your competitor instead.

An AI voice receptionist answers every call, books appointments while you're working, detects emergencies and transfers them immediately, and captures leads 24/7. It doesn't replace you - it makes sure you never miss the calls where customers are trying to reach you.

Most important: backup your Grasshopper data before you start. Those text messages and voicemails are deleted permanently after porting, and there's no way to recover them later.

Ready to migrate? Start your NextPhone trial and our migration team will guide you through every step - from document submission to AI setup. You'll be fully operational in under two weeks with the same phone number your customers already know.
