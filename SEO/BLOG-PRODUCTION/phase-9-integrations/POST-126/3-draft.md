---

You're managing 10 agency clients in HighLevel. Each one gets about 30 calls a month. That's 300 calls totaland if your experience matches what we've seen, 222 of those calls are going straight to voicemail.

Here's the problem: HighLevel's native LC-Phone system is built for click-to-call, not automatic answering. Your team has to be available, logged in, and ready to manually pick up. Miss the call? Miss the lead. And when you're juggling multiple client accounts, meetings, and campaigns, you can't be glued to the phone 24/7.

In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 small businesses over 7 months, we found that 74.1% of calls go unanswered. For an agency with 10 clients, that's not just inconvenientit's a revenue crisis for your clients and a retention risk for you.

The solution isn't another manual system. You need AI integration that works across all your HighLevel sub-accounts, automatically answers every call, qualifies leads in real-time, and creates contacts and opportunities without you lifting a finger.

Here's how to set up HighLevel integration with NextPhoneand why agencies are using this to both improve client results and create a new recurring revenue stream.

## What Is HighLevel CRM?

HighLevel (also called GoHighLevel) is an all-in-one marketing platform built specifically for agencies, consultants, and marketers who manage multiple clients. Unlike traditional CRMs that charge per user or contact, [HighLevel's pricing structure](https://ghl-services-playbooks-automation-crm-marketing.ghost.io/gohighlevel-pricing-plans-explained-features-value-cost-comparison-2025/) is designed around agencies managing unlimited client accounts under one subscription.

The platform includes everything you'd normally cobble together from 5+ tools: CRM, landing pages, forms, email marketing, SMS campaigns, workflow automation, scheduling, and payment processing. The real differentiator? White-label capability. You can brand HighLevel as your own platform with custom domains and a branded desktop app.

**Pricing tiers:**

- **Starter:** $97/month (small businesses and freelancers)
- **Unlimited:** $297/month (agencies with multiple clients) � Most popular
- **SaaS Pro:** $497/month (full white-label resale with automated billing)

Annual plans save you 16.6% (essentially 2 months free).

The Unlimited and SaaS Pro plans give you unlimited sub-accounts, which means you can manage 10, 50, or 500 clients under one subscription. This is why HighLevel dominates the agency space.

### The LC-Phone Limitation

HighLevel includes a [native phone system called LC-Phone](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001223546-what-is-lc-lead-connector-phone-system-). On paper, it sounds great: calls and SMS integrated right into the CRM, no Twilio setup required.

Here's the catch: LC-Phone is a click-to-call system. It doesn't automatically answer incoming calls. Someone on your team has to be logged in, available, and ready to manually pick up.

**What this means:**

- After-hours calls? Missed.
- Team in a client meeting? Missed.
- Lunch break? Missed.
- Calls coming in across 10 different client accounts while you're working on strategy? Missed.

LC-Phone also comes with usage fees on top of your HighLevel subscription:

- Inbound calls: $0.0085 per minute
- Outbound calls: $0.014 per minute
- Local phone number: $1.15 per month

For agencies with light call volume, those fees are manageable. But if your clients are getting 300+ calls a month, you're paying for a manual system that still requires your team to be available 24/7. And you're still missing 74% of those calls.

## Why Agencies Need Automatic Phone Answering

Manual phone management doesn't scale when you're managing multiple client accounts. The math becomes brutal fast.

### Multi-Client Call Volume

Let's use a conservative example. You have 10 clients. Each one gets 30 calls per month on average. That's 300 total calls across your client base.

According to our data (13,175 calls analyzed), 74.1% of calls go unanswered when businesses rely on manual phone pickup. That's 222 missed calls every month across your 10 clients.

Each of those missed calls is a potential lead for your clientor worse, an existing customer trying to reach them. If your clients are in competitive industries (real estate, home services, legal), a single missed call could mean a $5,000, $50,000, or $500,000 deal lost to a competitor who answered.

### After-Hours Problem

Agencies often work across time zones. Your clients' customers don't stop calling at 5 PM. They call when they need somethingevenings, weekends, holidays.

LC-Phone only works when your team is logged in and available. No one's clicking to answer calls at 9 PM on a Saturday. So those calls go to voicemail, and by Monday morning, the lead has already called three of your client's competitors.

This isn't just a lead capture problem. It's a client retention problem. When your clients see their call volume dropping or their leads going cold, they start questioning the value of your services.

### Manual Admin Burden

According to research from [Nimbata's call tracking study](https://www.nimbata.com/tips/pipedrive-call-tracking-guide), sales teams spend up to 30% of their time on administrative tasks like logging calls and updating CRM records.

Now multiply that across 10+ client sub-accounts. You're jumping between dashboards, manually logging calls, entering notes, tagging contacts, and assigning leads to pipelines.

That's time you could spend on strategy, campaign optimization, or landing new clients. Instead, you're doing data entry that a webhook could handle in 2 seconds.

### Revenue Impact

Here's the calculation that makes agency owners pay attention:

- 300 calls per month (10 clients � 30 calls each)
- 74.1% missed = 222 unanswered calls
- 15% of those would convert (conservative estimate) = 33 conversions
- Average deal value of $3,000 (also conservative)

**That's $99,945 in lost revenue every month across your client base.**

Even if your conversion and deal value numbers are half that, you're still looking at $50,000/month your clients aren't capturing because calls go unanswered.

And when clients don't see results, they churn. You lose MRR, and you spend even more time and money replacing them.

## How HighLevel + NextPhone Integration Works

Instead of relying on LC-Phone's manual click-to-call system, you can integrate NextPhone with HighLevel using [HTTP webhooks](https://help.gohighlevel.com/support/solutions/articles/48001238167-guide-to-custom-webhook-workflow-action). This gives you automatic call answering across all your sub-accounts without adding more manual work.

### Integration Architecture

NextPhone uses HighLevel's Custom Webhook workflow action to send call data in real-time to the HighLevel API. This works across unlimited sub-accountsyou set it up once, and it routes calls to the correct client account automatically.

You don't need LC-Phone subscriptions for each client. You don't need to train your team to manually log calls. The AI answers, qualifies, and logs everything automatically.

### Call Flow

Here's what happens when a call comes in:

1. **Call arrives** � NextPhone's AI answers automatically (no human required)
2. **AI conversation** � Collects name, email, company, needs, budget, timeline
3. **Webhook triggers** � Sends data to HighLevel API in real-time
4. **Contact created** � New contact added to the correct sub-account with all details
5. **Opportunity created** � Deal added to pipeline if qualified
6. **Activity logged** � Call notes and transcript attached to contact record
7. **Workflow triggered** � HighLevel automation sends follow-up SMS or email

All of this happens in seconds, with zero manual input from your team.

### HighLevel API Endpoints

NextPhone's webhook can hit several HighLevel API endpoints depending on what you want to automate:

- **Create Contact:** `POST https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/`
- **Create Opportunity:** `POST https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/opportunities/`
- **Log Activity:** `POST https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/{contactId}/notes/`

Each endpoint accepts different data fields, and you can customize which information gets sent based on what the AI collects during the call.

### Webhook Template Example

Here's an example webhook configuration for creating a contact in HighLevel:

```json
POST https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/

Headers:
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN",
  "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

Body:
{
  "locationId": "{{sub_account_id}}",
  "firstName": "{{first_name}}",
  "lastName": "{{last_name}}",
  "email": "{{email}}",
  "phone": "{{caller_number}}",
  "source": "NextPhone AI",
  "tags": ["ai-call", "inbound-lead"],
  "customFields": [
    {
      "id": "budget_field_id",
      "value": "{{budget}}"
    },
    {
      "id": "timeline_field_id",
      "value": "{{timeline}}"
    }
  ]
}
```

The `{{template_variables}}` auto-populate from the AI conversation. The `locationId` parameter routes the contact to the correct client sub-account. Tags like `"ai-call"` can trigger HighLevel workflows for automated follow-up.

You can also create opportunities (deals) directly from calls by hitting the opportunities endpoint with similar data.

## Agency-Specific Benefits

HighLevel's multi-sub-account structure makes it perfect for agenciesbut only if your phone system works the same way. Here's why NextPhone's integration is built for agencies managing multiple clients.

### Multi-Sub-Account Management

One NextPhone webhook integration works across all your client accounts. You don't need separate setups for each sub-account. The `locationId` parameter in the webhook automatically routes each call to the correct client.

**What this means:**

- Add a new client? Just assign their phone number and locationId. Done.
- No per-client configuration or technical setup.
- Centralized management for your entire agency client base.
- All call data flows into the right sub-accounts automatically.

If you're managing 50 clients in HighLevel, you don't want to configure 50 separate phone integrations. You want one system that scales.

### White-Label Resale Opportunity

Here's where agencies get creative. HighLevel's SaaS Pro plan ($497/month) lets you white-label and resell the entire platform to clients. You can do the same with NextPhone.

**Agency resale model:**

- Your cost: $199/month per client for NextPhone
- Your resale price: $299/month (or bundle into your retainer)
- Profit margin: $100/month per client

With 10 clients, that's $1,000/month in recurring revenue. With 25 clients, it's $2,500/month. And you're delivering real valueautomatic call answering that captures leads your clients would otherwise miss.

Many agencies don't charge separately. They bundle NextPhone into a $2,000-$5,000/month retainer and position it as part of their "full-service lead generation" offering. Either way, it's a margin opportunity.

### Client Retention Tool

Agencies lose clients for a lot of reasons, but one of the most common is "we're not getting enough leads." What they often mean is: "we're not converting the leads we're getting."

When 74% of calls go unanswered, your client sees their phone ringing in HighLevel's dashboard but no one's picking up. They think the problem is your marketing. In reality, the problem is they're missing the calls your marketing is driving.

Automatic answering fixes that perception problem. Your clients see every call answered, every lead logged, and every opportunity captured. You have data showing exact call volume, qualification rates, and follow-up activity.

This isn't just about better results. It's about proving value. When clients can see that you're capturing 100% of inbound calls (instead of 26%), they're far less likely to churn.

### Time Savings Across Clients

Without automation, you're manually logging calls across 10, 20, or 50 client dashboards. That's hours of admin work every week.

With AI answering and automatic logging, you eliminate that entirely. The AI handles qualification. The webhook logs everything. HighLevel workflows handle follow-up.

Your team focuses on strategy, creative, and high-value work. Not data entry.

And because you're not adding headcount to manage more clients, your margins improve as you scale.

## Setup Process

Setting up HighLevel integration with NextPhone takes about 10-15 minutes per sub-account. Once you've done it once, duplicating the setup for additional clients takes just a few minutes.

### Step 1: Get HighLevel API Credentials

In HighLevel, go to **Settings � Integrations � API Key**. Copy your API key and store it somewhere secure (password manager, not a sticky note).

You'll also need the `locationId` for each sub-account where you want calls logged. You can find this in the sub-account settings or by querying the HighLevel API.

### Step 2: Configure NextPhone Webhook

In your NextPhone dashboard, go to **Integrations � HTTP Webhook**. Enter the HighLevel API endpoint (like `https://rest.gohighlevel.com/v1/contacts/`).

Add your Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

Map your template variables to match HighLevel's expected fields (firstName, lastName, email, phone, etc.). NextPhone will auto-populate these from the AI conversation.

### Step 3: Set Up AI Call Script

Define what questions the AI should ask during calls. For example:

- "Can I get your name and email?"
- "What's the best number to reach you?"
- "What service are you interested in?"
- "What's your budget and timeline?"

Configure routing rules if you want calls to go to different sub-accounts based on the caller's area code or other criteria.

Test the AI script with a sample call to make sure the conversation flows naturally.

### Step 4: Create HighLevel Workflow (Optional)

Once contacts are being created with tags like `"ai-call"`, you can set up HighLevel workflows to automate follow-up.

Example workflow:

- **Trigger:** New contact added with tag "ai-call"
- **Action 1:** Send SMS: "Thanks for calling! We'll follow up within 24 hours."
- **Action 2:** Assign contact to sales pipeline (stage: New Lead)
- **Action 3:** Notify team via Slack or email

This makes sure no AI-captured lead falls through the cracks.

### Step 5: Test Integration

Make a test call to your NextPhone number. Verify:

- Contact created in the correct HighLevel sub-account
- Data fields populated accurately (name, email, phone, custom fields)
- Tags applied correctly
- Workflows triggered as expected

If everything looks good, you're live.

## HighLevel vs NextPhone Cost Comparison

Let's break down the real cost of phone integration for an agency managing 10 clients.

### Option 1: HighLevel + LC-Phone

- Base: $297/month (Unlimited plan)
- Phone numbers: $1.15/month � 10 = $11.50
- Inbound calls: 300 calls � 3 min avg � $0.0085/min = $7.65
- Outbound calls: 100 calls � 2 min avg � $0.014/min = $2.80

**Total: ~$319/month**

**Limitation:** Manual click-to-call only. No automatic answering. Your team has to be available 24/7 to pick up calls. Still missing 74% of inbound calls.

### Option 2: HighLevel + NextPhone

- Base: $297/month (Unlimited HighLevel)
- NextPhone: $199/month � 10 clients = $1,990

**Total: $2,287/month**

**Benefit:** Full AI answering, 24/7 coverage, automatic contact/opportunity creation, zero manual call logging, works across unlimited sub-accounts.

### Agency Resale Model

If you resell NextPhone to clients at $299/month:

- Cost: $2,287/month
- Revenue: $299/month � 10 = $2,990/month
- **Profit: $703/month recurring**

And that's just the margin on the phone service. The real ROI is capturing the $99,945/month in previously missed opportunities across your client base and preventing client churn from poor lead response.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can NextPhone work with HighLevel's native LC-Phone?

NextPhone replaces LC-Phone for inbound call answering. You can still use LC-Phone for outbound calling if you want, but most agencies prefer NextPhone's all-in-one approach to eliminate multiple bills and systems.

### Will it work across all my sub-accounts?

Yes. One webhook integration routes calls to unlimited sub-accounts using the `locationId` parameter. Each client gets their own phone number and AI configuration, but the integration is centralized.

### Can I white-label NextPhone for my agency clients?

Absolutely. You can brand the service as your own and resell it as part of your agency's offerings. Many agencies package it into monthly retainers or charge it as a separate line item.

### Does it integrate with HighLevel workflows?

Yes. When NextPhone creates a contact with specific tags (like "ai-call"), you can trigger HighLevel workflows to send automated SMS, emails, assign to pipelines, or notify your team. The integration is fully compatible with HighLevel's automation builder.

### What happens to calls after hours?

NextPhone's AI answers 24/7 automatically. After-hours calls are captured, qualified, and logged in HighLevel just like business-hours calls. No missed opportunities, no weekend voicemails.

### How long does setup take?

Initial webhook configuration takes 10-15 minutes. Once you've set it up for one sub-account, duplicating the setup for additional clients takes just a few minutes each.

## Stop Missing 74% of Client Calls

HighLevel is a powerful platform for agencies. But without automatic call answering, you're still losing 74.1% of inbound calls across your client base.

LC-Phone's click-to-call system requires your team to be available 24/7. That doesn't scale when you're managing 10, 20, or 50 clients.

AI integration with NextPhone gives you automatic answering across unlimited sub-accounts, real-time contact and opportunity creation via webhooks, and a white-label resale opportunity that adds recurring revenue to your agency.

Setup takes 10-15 minutes. The ROI shows up in client retention, reduced admin time, and captured revenue that would otherwise go to competitors who answered the phone.
