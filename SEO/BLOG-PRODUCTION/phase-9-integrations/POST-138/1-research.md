## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

### Key Search Patterns

**Primary Intent: Problem-Solution**
Users are frustrated with:
- Calendly discontinuing Apple Calendar support (August 2024)
- Complex CalDAV setup requirements
- App-specific password confusion
- Lack of seamless AI receptionist integration for Mac users

**Secondary Intent: Workflow Optimization**
Apple ecosystem users (Mac + iPhone + iPad) want:
- Single source of truth for appointments
- Automatic syncing across all devices
- Integration with business tools without leaving Apple ecosystem
- Professional appearance for client-facing scheduling

### Real User Concerns (from search results and industry context):

**Technical Concerns:**
- "Does iCloud calendar support webhooks?" (Answer: No, major limitation)
- "Why does Apple Calendar require app-specific passwords?" (Security model)
- "Can I use OAuth with iCloud calendar?" (No, CalDAV uses Basic Auth)
- "Will my calendar sync in real-time?" (Depends on implementation)

**Business Concerns:**
- "I'm a creative professional on Mac - what AI receptionist works with my setup?"
- "Calendly dropped Apple Calendar - what now?"
- "How do I avoid double-booking across my Mac and iPhone?"
- "Can AI book appointments while I'm in client meetings?"
- "Will clients see my personal calendar events?" (Privacy concern)

**Use Case Examples (implied from research):**
- Freelance photographer: "I'm on-site shooting, phone rings for booking - AI needs to check my calendar and book if I'm available"
- Design agency: "Team uses all Macs - need AI receptionist that works with our iCloud calendars"
- Consultant: "Travel between Mac, iPad, iPhone - calendar must sync everywhere instantly"
- Small law firm: "All attorneys use MacBooks - need appointment scheduling that integrates with Apple Calendar"

### Pain Points Identified:

1. **Calendly Gap**: Major scheduling tool no longer supports Apple Calendar (as of Aug 2024)
2. **Technical Barrier**: CalDAV setup intimidates non-technical users
3. **Authentication Friction**: App-specific passwords are confusing
4. **Ecosystem Lock-in**: Apple users want to stay in Apple ecosystem but lack good AI receptionist options
5. **Real-time Sync**: Uncertainty about whether bookings will sync fast enough to prevent double-booking
