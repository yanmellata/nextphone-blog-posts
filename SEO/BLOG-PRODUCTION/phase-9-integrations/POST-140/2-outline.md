## SECTION 1: The Hidden Cost of Missed Calls for Service Professionals

**Purpose:** Establish the problem with data - service professionals are bleeding revenue from missed calls
**Word Count Target:** 300-350 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. The Reality: Most Calls Go Unanswered
2. Why Service Professionals Can't Answer
3. The Revenue Impact

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Service professionals (therapists, coaches, consultants) work 1-on-1 with clients
- When you're in session, you can't answer the phone
- Between sessions, you're doing admin work, not phone duty
- Evenings/weekends = when many clients try to reach you
- The math: 42 calls/month × 74.1% missed × 30% conversion × $150 session = $1,395/month lost = $16,740/year
- Callback requests fall through cracks (25.4% of callers ask for callbacks, 80% never get them)

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services customers over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Stat 2:** "Each missed call represents lost revenue, with practices receiving 100 new patient calls monthly potentially losing over $200,000 annually" - Source: Resonateapp
- **Stat 3:** "Therapists spend 15-20 hours weekly on administrative tasks" - Source: Simply.coach

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Scenario: Therapist in session with client, phone rings in waiting room with new patient inquiry. Goes to voicemail. New patient calls next practice. $150/session × 10 sessions = $1,500 lost
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow."

## SECTION 5: Intake Forms: Online Booking vs Phone Call Collection

**Purpose:** Compare how intake forms work in standard Acuity vs AI phone collection
**Word Count Target:** 300-350 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. How Acuity Intake Forms Work
2. The Limitation: Phone Callers Can't Fill Forms
3. AI Solution: Collecting Intake Data During Calls

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Acuity intake forms:**
  - Custom forms for each appointment type
  - Clients fill out when booking online
  - Collects important info before session (symptoms, goals, medical history, referral source)
  - SOAP notes for healthcare (marked internal use only)
  - **Limitation:** Can't be filled when buying packages/subscriptions
  - **Limitation:** Only works for online self-booking, not phone calls
- **The problem:**
  - When clients call, they can't fill out intake forms
  - Therapist has to email forms after call (extra step, often forgotten)
  - Client may not fill out, arrives unprepared
  - Wastes first 10 minutes of session gathering basic info
- **AI phone solution:**
  - AI can ask intake form questions during phone conversation
  - Natural dialogue: "What symptoms are you experiencing?" "Have you had therapy before?" "Who referred you to our practice?"
  - AI structures responses into data fields
  - Pushes structured data to Acuity via webhook (attached to appointment)
  - No follow-up email needed, client arrives with intake complete

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Limitation:** "Clients can't complete intake forms when buying a package, gift certificate, or subscription" - Source: Acuity help docs

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Therapist intake form asks: "What brings you to therapy today?" "Have you been in therapy before?" "Any medications?" - AI can ask these conversationally during booking call, structure the responses, and attach to Acuity appointment
