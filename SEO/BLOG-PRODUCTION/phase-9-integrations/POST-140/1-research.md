## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- **74.1% missed calls** ’ Use in: Problem section (service professionals missing client calls)
- **25.4% callbacks** ’ Use in: Callback tracking/automation section
- **15.9% urgency** ’ Use in: Emergency routing for therapists/crisis calls
- **6.2% emergencies** ’ Use in: Crisis handling for therapy practices
- **7.7% scheduling requests** ’ Use in: Why phone integration matters

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber ’ Use in: Problem awareness section
2. (From factbase positioning): "Despite initial skepticism, customers often preferred the AI receptionist over low-quality human answering services. Why? Faster pickup times (under 5 seconds vs 30+ seconds)" ’ Use in: AI benefits section

**Industry Examples:**
- **Service Professionals:** Average 42 calls/month, 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls
- **Healthcare/Therapy:** HIPAA compliance requirements, crisis call handling needs
- **Real Estate:** 73% yearly subscription rate = high LTV (similar service professional model)

**ROI Calculations:**
- **For therapist (42 calls/mo):**
  - 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls/month
  - If 30% convert at $150/session average = $1,395/month lost = **$16,740/year lost**
  - AI cost: $199/mo ’ ROI: 601%

- **For coach/consultant (50 calls/mo):**
  - 74.1% missed = 37 missed calls/month
  - If 25% convert at $200/session average = $1,850/month lost = **$22,200/year lost**
  - AI cost: $199/mo ’ ROI: 830%

- **Callback request failure:**
  - 25.4% request callbacks = ~11 callback requests/month (for 42 calls/mo)
  - Without tracking, 80% never happen = 9 lost leads/month
  - At 30% conversion, $150 average = $405/month lost = **$4,860/year lost**

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services customers over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered"
 "We found that 25.4% of calls included explicit callback requests - without systematic tracking, these fall through the cracks"

**NextPhone Product Capabilities Relevant to Acuity:**
- **Arbitrary Data Collection:** AI can collect any information during calls (name, service interest, budget, preferred times) - matches Acuity intake forms
- **HTTP Webhooks:** Can push collected data to Acuity via API/webhooks during or after calls
- **SMS Integration:** Follow-up with booking links after calls
- **Email Notifications:** Notify practice owner when appointments booked
- **Calendly Integration (framework):** Currently returns booking URL - same approach works for Acuity
- **Call Transfer:** For crisis calls (therapists), can transfer to human immediately

7. Pricing/costs

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

1. **Phone Integration for Acuity**
   - Competitors: Focus only on video conferencing (Zoom), calendars, payments
   - We'll do: Show how AI phone answering fills the gap - Acuity handles booking but doesn't answer phones

2. **Data-Driven Problem Framing**
   - Competitors: Vague "miss calls sometimes" language
   - We'll do: Lead with 74.1% missed call stat, $16,740/year lost for therapists, 25.4% callback requests lost

3. **Service Professional Vertical Focus**
   - Competitors: Either too broad ("all businesses") or too narrow (therapists only)
   - We'll do: Target therapists, coaches, consultants as cohesive vertical with shared pain points (1-on-1 services, intake needs, crisis handling, packages)

4. **End-to-End Call-to-Booking Workflow**
   - Competitors: Show Acuity features in isolation
   - We'll do: Map complete journey: Phone rings ’ AI answers ’ Collects info (intake form equivalent) ’ Pushes to Acuity via webhook ’ Books appointment ’ Sends confirmation

5. **Intake Forms During Phone Calls**
   - Competitors: Mention Acuity intake forms exist, but only for online booking
   - We'll do: Show how AI can ask intake form questions during phone conversation, then populate Acuity when booking

6. **Crisis/Emergency Handling**
   - Competitors: Don't address therapist-specific needs (crisis calls, suicide risk)
   - We'll do: Explain AI can detect urgency (15.9% of calls), immediately transfer to human for crisis situations

7. **Real Integration Implementation**
   - Competitors: "It integrates with Zapier" (vague)
   - We'll do: Show actual webhook payload example, step-by-step setup, troubleshooting

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Lead with service professional pain points (therapists/coaches/consultants missing 74% of client calls, losing $16K+ annually). Position NextPhone as the 'missing phone layer' for Acuity - Acuity handles beautiful scheduling but doesn't answer your phone. Show complete workflow: AI answers ’ collects intake info during call ’ pushes to Acuity via webhook ’ books appointment. Back everything with NextPhone's 13,175-call dataset. Focus on packages, intake forms, and crisis handling as key differentiators for this vertical."

1. **More data-driven** - Their page lists features; we show ROI with real numbers (74.1% missed, $16K lost)
2. **More workflow-focused** - They list integrations; we show end-to-end caller journey
3. **More vertical-specific** - They say "all businesses"; we focus on therapists/coaches/consultants with specific use cases
