### KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Above-fold summary for scanability
**Word Count Target:** 60-80 words (4-5 bullets)

**Bullets:**
- Ooma Office is a popular small business VoIP system, but 74.1% of calls still go unanswered according to our analysis of 13,175 calls
- Traditional integrations (CRM, call forwarding) don't solve the core problem of missed calls when you're working
- AI receptionists provide 24/7 coverage, smart call routing, and automatic callback tracking
- NextPhone works alongside your existing Ooma setup for $199/month vs hiring a full-time receptionist
- Typical contractors lose $260,400/year from missed calls - NextPhone captures these for a 100x+ ROI

### SECTION 2: The Missed Call Problem (Data-Driven)

**H2 Title:** The Real Cost of Missed Calls for Small Businesses

**Purpose:** Establish problem with hard data, make it personal for contractors
**Word Count Target:** 250-280 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. How Many Calls Actually Go Unanswered?
2. Why Contractors Miss Calls
3. The Revenue Impact

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Our analysis: 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months
- 74.1% went completely unanswered
- That's 3 out of 4 potential customers calling someone else
- Why: On job site, hands dirty, on ladder, under house, safety regulations
- Specific trades: Roofers on roof, plumbers under sink, electricians in attic
- These aren't "unimportant" calls - 25.4% requested callbacks, 15.9% were urgent
- Revenue math: 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 = $260,400/year lost

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **74.1% of calls unanswered** - Source: NextPhone analysis of 13,175 calls
- **25.4% explicitly requested callbacks** - Source: Same study
- **15.9% contained urgency language** - Source: Same study
- **Revenue calculation:** $260,400/year lost for typical contractor
- Customer quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data"

### SECTION 3: Traditional Integration Options (and Their Limitations)

**H2 Title:** Traditional Ooma Integrations Don't Solve the Core Problem

**Purpose:** Acknowledge existing solutions, explain why they fall short
**Word Count Target:** 200-220 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Call Forwarding to Mobile
2. CRM Integrations
3. The After-Hours Coverage Gap

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Call forwarding:** Forwards to mobile, but you still can't answer if working
- Customers hear ringing, then voicemail - same problem
- **CRM integrations:** Via Zapier, logs call data, but doesn't answer the call
- Doesn't help capture the lead in first place
- **After-hours:** Manual setup, requires you to manage schedule
- Still relies on you being available
- **Virtual receptionist:** Basic "press 1 for sales" - no intelligence
- Can't qualify leads, detect emergencies, or have real conversation
- Bottom line: Traditional integrations automate data logging, not call answering

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- "Traditional phone systems require 15-30 minutes average setup per integration"

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: Call forwards to mobile, contractor sees it while on ladder, can't answer safely
- Example: Customer presses "1" for sales on auto-attendant, still gets voicemail

**Visual Needed:**
- None (keep focused)
