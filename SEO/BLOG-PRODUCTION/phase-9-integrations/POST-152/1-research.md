- **25.4% callbacks** ’ Use in: Callback tracking section
- **15.9% urgency** ’ Use in: Emergency routing section
- **6.2% emergencies** ’ Use in: Contractor use case
- **7.0% spam** ’ Use in: Call screening benefit

**Customer Quotes:**

2. [From factbase context about contractors missing calls while on job sites] ’ Use in: Use case section

**Industry Examples:**
- **General Contractors (19 customers):** Average 42 calls/month, 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls
- **Roofing (6 customers):** Can't answer phone while on roof, emergency calls critical
- **Plumbing (3 customers):** Emergency calls (pipe burst) = highest revenue, after-hours common
- **Electrical (5 customers):** Safety regulations prevent answering during work

**ROI Calculations:**
- **Scenario 1: Typical contractor**
  - 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls/month
  - 20% conversion × $3,500 avg project = $21,700/month lost
  - Annual: $260,400/year lost
  - AI cost: $199/mo = $2,388/year
  - ROI: Capture even 2 extra jobs/month = $84,000/year gain, 35x ROI

- **Scenario 2: Emergency calls**
  - 15.9% urgency = ~7 urgent calls/month (42-call business)
  - Emergency avg: $4,200
  - Missing 1/week = $16,800/month lost = $201,600/year
  - AI prevents this loss for $2,388/year = 84x ROI

- **Scenario 3: Callback requests**
  - 25.4% request callbacks = 11/month
  - 80% callbacks never happen without system = 9 lost leads
  - 30% conversion × $3,500 = $9,450/month lost = $113,400/year
  - AI tracks all callbacks: $199/mo vs $113K lost

**How to Cite:**

## 1.6 GAP ANALYSIS & UNIQUE ANGLE

**Table Stakes (Must Cover):**
1. Brief overview of Ooma Office (what it is, pricing)
2. Why integrations matter for small business
3. Common integration types (CRM, call forwarding, etc.)
4. Limitations of basic integrations
5. Alternative solutions
6. How NextPhone works with existing systems
7. Cost comparison

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES):**

1. **Real missed call data**
   - Competitors: Vague claims like "don't miss calls"
   - We'll do: Lead with "74.1% of calls go unanswered" from 13,175 call study

2. **AI vs traditional integration angle**
   - Competitors: Focus only on traditional integrations (Zapier, basic forwarding)
   - We'll do: Position AI receptionist as modern alternative to limited integrations

3. **Contractor/trades focus**
   - Competitors: Generic small business
   - We'll do: Specific scenarios (on roof, under house, hands dirty) with real examples

4. **Transparent ROI calculations**
   - Competitors: Just list features and prices
   - We'll do: Show math - $199/mo vs $260K/year in lost revenue

5. **Emergency call routing intelligence**
   - Competitors: Mention call forwarding exists
   - We'll do: Highlight 15.9% of calls are urgent, AI can detect and route appropriately

6. **After-hours coverage gap**
   - Competitors: "Set up call forwarding"
   - We'll do: Show manual forwarding limitations vs 24/7 AI that never sleeps

7. **Callback tracking**
   - Competitors: Don't mention
   - We'll do: 25.4% request callbacks, 80% never happen without system

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Focus on small business VoIP users (especially Ooma) who need better integrations but find traditional options limited/expensive. Position NextPhone as intelligent layer that works WITH existing Ooma setup to handle missed calls, after-hours coverage, and smart routing - backed by real data from 13,175 calls showing 74.1% miss rate. Target contractors/trades with hands-on work preventing phone answers.

**How We'll Beat Competitors:**
1. **More data-driven:** Use proprietary 13,175 call analysis vs generic claims
2. **More specific audience:** Contractors/trades (plumbers, electricians, roofers) vs generic "small business"
3. **Better ROI transparency:** Show actual calculations ($260K/year lost vs $199/mo solution)
4. **Modern solution angle:** AI integration vs traditional CRM/Zapier focus
5. **Clearer structure:** Problem ’ Traditional solutions ’ Modern AI alternative ’ Implementation
6. **Real scenarios:** Specific use cases (on roof, emergency pipe burst) vs abstract benefits
