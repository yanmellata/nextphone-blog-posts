## NOTES & INSIGHTS

**Key Insights from Research:**
1. Verizon has major carrier advantage (99% network coverage, brand trust) but AI capabilities lag
2. OneTalk has serious reliability issues (30-50% failure rate reported by users)
3. Auto attendant is menu-driven (press 1 for X) vs conversational AI - major UX difference
4. Call forwarding is simple (*72 code) - low technical barrier for integration
5. Verizon's support is weak for OneTalk - common complaint across reviews
6. Pricing is opaque - no public pricing beyond "starts at $20/line"
7. Strong existing customer base looking for enhancements not replacements

**Positioning Strategy:**
- Don't position as "replace Verizon" - position as "upgrade your Verizon"
- Emphasize keeping existing infrastructure, number, network
- Focus on AI as the missing piece Verizon doesn't offer
- Use Verizon's own limitations (OneTalk problems) to make the case

**Writing Approach:**
- Speak to existing Verizon customers throughout ("If you're already using Verizon Business...")
- Use specific Verizon terminology (One Talk, auto receptionist, star codes)
- Address OneTalk problems empathetically (acknowledge frustrations)
- Show integration as simple, not technical (minimize jargon)
- Lead with missed call data - make the problem visceral
