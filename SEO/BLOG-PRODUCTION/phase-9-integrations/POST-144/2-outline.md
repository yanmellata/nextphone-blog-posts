## SECTION 0: KEY TAKEAWAYS BOX

**Purpose:** Provide scannable summary of entire post
**Word Count Target:** 100-120 words (6 bullets)

4. Integration is simple: forward calls using *72 code - takes 5 minutes, keeps your Verizon number and infrastructure
5. Cost: Verizon auto attendant ~$20-40/mo (menu-driven) vs AI receptionist $199/mo (conversational, unlimited calls) vs human receptionist $2,900/mo
6. No contract changes needed - AI layers on top of existing Verizon Business service via call forwarding

- Revenue math: 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 = $260K/year lost
- Emergency calls are highest value ($4,200 avg) - missing one/week = $16,800/mo lost

- Auto attendants can't: qualify leads, book appointments, take messages, send follow-ups
- Customer frustration: menu navigation vs conversation

**Data/Stats to Include:**

- **Stat 3:** "15.9% of calls contained urgency keywords, 6.2% were true emergencies" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Calculation:** 42 calls × 74.1% × 20% × $3,500 = $21,700/mo = $260,400/year

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls/month
