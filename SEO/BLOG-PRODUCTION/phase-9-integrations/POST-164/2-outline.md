## SECTION 6: PRICING COMPARISON & ROI

**Purpose:** Transparent cost analysis and ROI justification
**Word Count Target:** 400-500 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. HCP Assist Pricing
2. CSR AI Pricing
3. NextPhone Pricing
4. ROI Calculation: What You're Losing vs What You're Spending
5. Comparison Table

**Key Points to Cover:**

**HCP Assist Pricing:**
- Typically per-call or per-minute pricing model
- After-hours, weekend, or 24/7 coverage options
- Pricing not publicly listed (contact sales)
- Estimated: $300-600/month for moderate volume
- Cost scales with call volume (problem for busy seasons)

**CSR AI Pricing:**
- Integrated with Housecall Pro subscription
- Specific pricing not publicly disclosed
- Likely included in higher-tier plans or add-on fee
- More affordable than HCP Assist but less customizable

**NextPhone Pricing:**
- $199/month unlimited calls
- No per-call fees
- No setup fees
- Includes: AI answering, transcripts, webhooks, SMS, email notifications
- Works with any Housecall Pro plan (via Zapier if not on MAX)

**ROI Calculation:**
- Average contractor: 42 calls/month (industry benchmark)
- Miss rate: 74.1% = 31 missed calls/month
- Conversion rate: 20% (conservative)
- Average job value: $3,500
- Monthly loss: 31 × 20% × $3,500 = $21,700/month
- Annual loss: $260,400/year
- NextPhone cost: $199/month = $2,388/year
- ROI: Capture just 1.5 extra jobs/month to break even (already missing 31)

**Emergency Call Economics:**
- 15.9% of calls are urgent = ~7 urgent calls/month for 42-call business
- Emergency jobs: $4,200 average
- Missing 1 emergency/week = $16,800/month lost
- NextPhone emergency routing pays for itself by capturing 1 extra emergency every 2 months

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- 42 calls/month average (industry)
- 74.1% missed (NextPhone data)
- $1,200 per missed call (Housecall Pro stat)
- $260,400/year lost calculation
- $199/month NextPhone pricing
- ROI: 10,800% (recovering $21,700/month for $199 investment)

**Examples/Quotes:**
- "For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, if 74.1% go unanswered (31 missed calls), and just 20% would have converted at an average $3,500 project value, that's $21,700 per month in lost revenueor $260,400 per year."

**Visual Needed:**
- Type: Comparison table
- Placement: After subsection 5
- Description: 4-column table: Feature | HCP Assist | CSR AI | NextPhone (rows: monthly cost, call limits, integration method, emergency routing, after-hours, customization, plan requirement)
