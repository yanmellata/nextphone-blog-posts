## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 74.1% missed calls ’ Use in: Why automation matters (intro hook, problem section)
- 25.4% callbacks ’ Use in: Callback automation workflow example
- 15.9% urgency ’ Use in: Emergency routing scenario with Make.com
- 6.2% emergencies ’ Use in: Conditional logic example (route emergencies differently)
- 7.0% spam ’ Use in: Filtering workflow example

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls in one month ’ Use in: Problem awareness section
2. "Your phone rings at 9 PM. A customer needs emergency AC repair95-degree heat, no cooling. You're at dinner. The call goes to voicemail." ’ Use in: Intro hook

**Industry Examples:**
- **General Contractors:** 42 calls/mo average, 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls, $260,400/year lost
- **Electricians:** 15.5% spam rate, need intelligent filtering
- **HVAC:** Emergency calls average $4,200 (higher than routine), need urgent routing

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed × 20% close rate × $3,500 average = **$21,700/mo lost** = **$260,400/year lost**
- Make.com Core Plan: $9/month (10,000 operations)
- Typical AI receptionist + CRM workflow: ~150 operations per call (answer, log, route, notify)
- 42 calls/mo × 150 operations = 6,300 operations/month = fits in Core Plan
- **Total cost:** $9/mo (Make) + $199/mo (NextPhone) = $208/mo
- **ROI:** Recover 20% of lost calls (6 jobs/mo × $3,500) = $21,000/mo revenue vs $208 cost = **10,000% ROI**

**How to Cite:**
 "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 45 home services contractors over 7 months, 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered."
 "We found that 25.4% of calls included explicit callback requeststhese can be automatically logged and tracked using Make.com workflows."
 "15.9% of calls contained urgency keywords. Make.com's router logic can detect these patterns and route emergency calls differently."

3. **Emergency Routing Scenarios** - Competitors: Basic if/then examples, We'll do: Show how routers handle urgent vs routine calls using NextPhone's urgency detection (15.9% of calls)
4. **Callback Automation Workflow** - Competitors: Generic lead capture, We'll do: Build on 25.4% callback stat to show automated callback scheduling with Make.com
5. **Small Business ROI Math** - Competitors: "Save time and money", We'll do: Show $260K/year lost calls recovered with $208/mo total cost

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> Lead with NextPhone's 74.1% missed call data, position Make.com as the bridge between AI receptionist and existing business tools (CRM, calendar, spreadsheets).

Make advanced features (routers, filters, branching) accessible through concrete AI phone examples.

**How We'll Beat #1:**
1. **More data-driven** - Use proprietary 13,175 call analysis vs generic stats
2. **More practical** - Show exact operation counts and costs vs vague pricing info
3. **More specific** - AI receptionist workflows vs generic automation
4. **Better ROI proof** - $260K lost revenue vs $208/mo cost with real math
