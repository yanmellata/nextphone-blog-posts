## SECTION 3: Advanced Features: Routers, Filters, and Branching Logic Made Simple

**Purpose:** Demystify advanced features through relatable AI phone examples
**Word Count Target:** 350-400 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Routers: Send Data Down Different Paths
2. Filters: Only Process What Matters
3. Real-World Branching: Emergency vs Routine Calls

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Routers** = traffic directors that split workflow based on conditions
- **Filters** = if/then gates that only pass data when criteria met
- **Branching** = different actions based on data (not possible in basic Zapier)
- These features enable smart automation (not just linear tasks)
- Example: Route urgent calls to your phone, routine calls to CRM only

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **15.9% of calls contain urgency keywords** - NextPhone data
- **6.2% are true emergencies** (pipe burst, power out, AC failure)
- Emergency calls average **$4,200** vs $3,500 for routine work

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: "Router logic: IF call summary contains 'emergency' OR 'urgent' OR 'ASAP' ’ Route 1: Immediately text owner + transfer call. ELSE ’ Route 2: Log to CRM + schedule callback"
- Quote: "Routers are Make's solution for branching workflows based on conditionsthink of them as traffic directors that send data down different paths"

## SECTION 4: Make.com vs Zapier: When to Choose Each Platform

**Purpose:** Honest comparison showing when Make.com is better choice
**Word Count Target:** 400-450 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. Pricing Models: Operations vs Tasks
2. Complexity Capabilities: Linear vs Multi-Branch
3. When to Choose Make.com (and When to Stick with Zapier)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Pricing:** Make = operations (more efficient for multi-step), Zapier = tasks (simpler but expensive)
- **Complexity:** Make handles branching/routing, Zapier is linear (good for simple workflows)
- **Integrations:** Zapier has 8,000+, Make has 2,400+ but deeper per-app
- **Learning curve:** Zapier easier to start, Make more powerful once you learn
- **When to choose Make:** Complex workflows, cost-sensitive, need branching logic, AI phone automation
- **When to choose Zapier:** Super simple tasks, already invested in ecosystem, need max integrations

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- Make: **$9/mo for 10,000 operations** (Core plan)
- Zapier: ~$20-30/mo for similar usage (higher per-task cost)
- Make can run **steps in parallel** (Zapier can't)
- Cost savings: **60-70% cheaper** for complex workflows

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example: "100 calls/month with 5-step workflow each = 500 operations on Make ($9/mo fits in Core). Same workflow = 500 tasks on Zapier (need higher tier, $20-30/mo)"
- Quote contrast: "Zapier is simpler and beginner-friendly. Make is powerful, flexible, and cost-efficientbest for power users and businesses that need complex workflows with branching logic"

2. Workflow 2: Callback Request Automation (25.4% of Calls)
3. Workflow 3: Lead Capture & CRM Logging (Every Call)
4. Why These Workflows Matter (Revenue Impact)

**Key Points to Cover:**
- Real workflows small businesses can build
- Step-by-step scenario descriptions in plain English
- Operation counts for cost prediction
- Revenue/time impact of each workflow

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **15.9% urgency calls** need immediate routing
- **25.4% request callbacks** (632 out of 2,487 calls)
- **74.1% missed calls** = lost revenue without automation
- Emergency calls = **$4,200 average** vs $3,500 routine
- Businesses responding within 1 minute = **391% higher conversion**

**Examples/Quotes:**
**Workflow 1 Example:**
"Trigger: AI call ends ’ Filter: Check if 'emergency' in transcript ’ Router: IF urgent ’ Path A: Send SMS to owner, forward call, create high-priority CRM task ’ Path B: Standard CRM logging, schedule callback. Operations used: ~8 per call"

**Workflow 2 Example:**
"Trigger: AI detects callback request ’ Extract: Caller name, number, best time ’ Create: Calendar event for callback ’ Log: CRM note with callback details ’ Notify: Email owner with summary. Operations used: ~6 per call. Without automation: 80% of callbacks never happen"

**Workflow 3 Example:**
"Every call: Extract caller info ’ Check: New or existing customer ’ Create/Update: CRM contact ’ Log: Call summary, transcript link, recording ’ Notify: Owner email. Operations used: ~5 per call. Impact: Never lose a lead"

**Visual Needed:**

**Key Points to Cover:**
- **Operations** = each action in a module (download file, send email, create record)
- Make pricing is operation-based (more efficient than task-based)
- Free plan: 1,000 operations/month, 2 active scenarios
- Core plan: $9/mo (annually), 10,000 operations, unlimited scenarios

- **Pro plan:** $16/mo for 10,000 operations + advanced features
- Typical contractor: 42 calls/month
- Lost revenue without automation: **$260,400/year**
- Cost with automation: $208/mo ($9 Make + $199 NextPhone)
- ROI: Recover 20% of lost calls = **10,000% ROI**

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Example calculation: "42 calls/month × 150 operations/call = 6,300 operations. Core plan ($9/mo) includes 10,000 operationsplenty of room. Add NextPhone ($199/mo) = $208/mo total. Recover just 6 jobs/month (20% of missed calls) at $3,500 each = $21,000/mo revenue vs $208/mo cost."
- Quote: "Small businesses typically benefit from the Core plan when automation needs are straightforward and budget constraints are significant"
