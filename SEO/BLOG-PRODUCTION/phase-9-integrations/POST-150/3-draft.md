## The Hidden Cost of Having a Phone System

Your phone rings. A homeowner needs emergency AC repairtheir system died in 95-degree heat. You're on a ladder installing ductwork at another job site. Your phone is in the truck. The call goes to voicemail.

They call the next HVAC contractor. You just lost a $3,500 job.

Here's the frustrating part: You're paying $36 per month for a business phone system. But the call still went unanswered.

If you're looking for a Nextiva alternative, you're not alone. Maybe the per-user pricing is adding up. Maybe you're frustrated with limited features or customer support. Maybe you're dealing with dropped calls or a buggy mobile app.

But here's the real question most comparison articles miss: Does switching to a different VoIP system actually solve your problem?

In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that **74.1% of calls went completely unanswered.** That's three out of every four potential customers calling someone else. For a typical contractor receiving 42 calls per month, that's $260,400 per year in lost revenue.

This article covers the top VoIP alternatives to Nextiva. But we're also going to introduce a fundamentally different approachone that might eliminate the need for a traditional phone system entirely.

## What is Nextiva?

### Nextiva's Core Offering

[Nextiva](https://www.nextiva.com) is a unified communications platform that combines VoIP phone service, video conferencing, team chat, and contact center capabilities into one system. Unlike basic VoIP providers, Nextiva positions itself as an all-in-one business communications hub.

The platform targets businesses of all sizes, from small teams to enterprise operations, with a particular focus on multisite retail and healthcare organizations.

### Nextiva's Strengths

According to [industry reviews](https://www.business.com/reviews/nextiva/), Nextiva offers several legitimate advantages:

- **99.999% uptime guarantee** for reliable call quality
- **24/7 customer support** with all subscription levels (at least in theory)
- **HIPAA compliance** for healthcare businesses
- **Omnichannel capabilities** for managing calls, texts, and social media in one inbox

### Who Uses Nextiva

Nextiva works well for mid-sized to large organizations that need enterprise-grade features like multi-location management, advanced analytics, and department-level call routing.

But for small businesses and solo operatorsespecially those working in the fieldNextiva comes with some significant tradeoffs.

---

## Why Businesses Look for Nextiva Alternatives

### High Per-User Pricing

[Nextiva pricing](https://www.business.com/reviews/nextiva/) ranges from $25 to $199 per user monthly. Here's the breakdown:

| Plan | Price/User/Month | Voice Calling? | Key Features | Best For |
|------|------------------|----------------|--------------|----------|
| Digital | $25 | No | Email, social media only | Digital-only teams |
| Professional | $36 | Yes | Voice, video, chat, SMS | Small businesses |
| Enterprise | $129+ | Yes | Advanced analytics, CRM | Large organizations |
| Contact Center | $199 | Yes | Auto-dialers, workforce mgmt | Call centers |

The Professional plan starts at $36 per user monthly. That might sound reasonable until you do the math:

- 3 users = $108/month ($1,296/year)
- 5 users = $180/month ($2,160/year)
- 10 users = $360/month ($4,320/year)

And that's just the base Professional tier. Need advanced features? You're looking at $129-$199 per user.

### Limited Features on Basic Plans

The $25 Digital plan sounds affordable, but here's the catch: it doesn't include voice or video calling. You get email and social media management only.

As one [comparison analysis](https://getvoip.com/blog/nextiva-alternatives/) noted, "The most basic Nextiva plan includes only social media messaging and emaillacking voice and video calling, team chat, SMS texting, and website chat."

For an actual business phone system, you're starting at $36 per user monthly minimum.

### Complex Sales Process

Unlike most modern SaaS tools, you can't just sign up for Nextiva online and start using it. The company requires you to book a consultation with a sales representative before purchasing any plan.

You can't even access a demo without scheduling a one-on-one consultation call.

For small business owners who value their time, this sales-heavy approach can be a dealbreaker.

### Reliability and Support Issues

Despite Nextiva's marketing around 24/7 support and reliability, [customer complaints](https://www.bbb.org/us/az/scottsdale/profile/telecommunications/nextiva-inc-1126-97030201/customer-reviews) paint a different picture:

- "Calls drop repeatedly or don't connect"
- "Lost business because I use Nextiva"
- "Mobile app is very problematic with echo at the beginning of calls"
- "Extremely difficult to get a customer service representative on the phone"

One reviewer noted that their phone is their "lifeline" for their small businessand when it doesn't work, they lose real money.

[Research shows](https://voipstudio.com/blog/the-impact-of-missed-calls-on-your-business/) that 85% of callers who can't reach a company on the first try won't call back. For a small business, even a few dropped calls can mean thousands in lost revenue.

## Top VoIP Alternatives to Nextiva

If you're looking for a VoIP-to-VoIP switch, here are the top alternatives:

### RingCentral

RingCentral offers superior AI features, deeper third-party integrations, and advanced collaboration tools compared to Nextiva. Pricing starts at $30-$45 per user monthly.

**Best for:** Small businesses and startups that want simple, familiar tools.

### Vonage

Vonage leads in developer-friendly features with strong APIs for building custom communication experiences. Pricing ranges from $20-$40 per user monthly.

**Best for:** Businesses with development teams wanting to build custom integrations.

| Provider | Starting Price/User | Key Strength | Best For |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|----------|
| RingCentral | $30-$45 | Deep integrations | CRM-heavy teams |
| Dialpad | $23-$35 | AI features | Sales & support |
| 8x8 | $24-$44 | Global reach | International teams |
| Zoom Phone | $15-$20 | Ease of use | Small businesses |
| Vonage | $20-$40 | Developer APIs | Custom builds |

According to [business phone system cost research](https://www.phone.com/how-much-do-business-phone-systems-cost-in-2025/), VoIP systems typically cost $15-$40 per user monthlyputting all these alternatives in the standard market range.

## Feature & Pricing Comparison

Here's how Nextiva stacks up against alternatives across key features:

| Feature | Nextiva | RingCentral | Dialpad | Zoom Phone | NextPhone (AI) |
|---------|---------|-------------|---------|------------|----------------|
| Unlimited Calling |  |  |  |  |  |
| Video Meetings |  |  |  |  | - |
| Team Chat |  |  |  |  | - |
| Mobile App |  |  |  |  |  |
| Auto-Attendant |  |  |  |  | AI-powered |
| Call Recording |  |  |  |  |  |
| CRM Integration | Add-on |  |  |  | Native |
| AI Features | Limited | Advanced | Best-in-class | Basic | Core feature |
| 24/7 Availability | Voicemail only | Voicemail only | Voicemail only | Voicemail only | AI answers |
| Price/Month | $36+/user | $30+/user | $23+/user | $15+/user | $199 flat |

All the VoIP alternatives offer similar core features: unlimited calling, video meetings, team chat, and mobile apps. The main differentiators are AI capabilities (where Dialpad excels), integrations (RingCentral's strength), and ease of use (Zoom Phone's advantage).

The pricing is comparable across the board, with most falling in the $20-$45 per user monthly range. If you have a team of five, you're looking at $100-$225 per month regardless of which VoIP provider you choose.

But there's something all these VoIP systems have in common: they still require a human being to actually answer the calls.

## The Real Problem VoIP Systems Don't Solve

### Having a Phone System ` Answering Calls

Here's the uncomfortable truth about business phone systems: VoIP gives you better technology, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem of who's going to answer.

If you're a solo contractor installing a roof, you can't answer the phone. If you're a plumber under a sink with wet hands, you can't answer the phone. If you're a real estate agent showing a property, you can't answer the phone.

A VoIP systemno matter how advancedstill goes to voicemail when you're unavailable.

### The Cost of Missed Calls

In our analysis of 13,175 customer service calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months, we found that **74.1% of calls went completely unanswered.** That's not because these businesses didn't have phone systems. It's because they were busy doing the actual work.

The data gets worse:

- **25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks** (632 out of 2,487 calls analyzed)
- **15.9% of calls contained urgency language** like "emergency," "urgent," or "ASAP"
- **6.2% were true emergencies** (pipe burst, no power, AC out in 95-degree heat)

[Research on missed calls](https://voipstudio.com/blog/the-impact-of-missed-calls-on-your-business/) shows that over 80% of people whose calls are unanswered won't call back. They'll simply call the next contractor.

Let's do the math on what this costs:

**For a typical contractor:**
- 42 calls per month (average from our data)
- 74.1% unanswered = 31 missed calls per month
- If just 20% would have converted at $3,500 average project value
- **That's $21,700 per month in lost revenue**
- **$260,400 per year**

One plumber in our study didn't realize he was missing 76 calls per month until he saw the data. His exact words: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls. I just thought business was slow."

He wasn't losing business because of his skills or pricing. He was losing it because nobody answered the phone.

### Why VoIP Systems Still Miss Calls

VoIP systems work great for:
- Businesses with dedicated receptionists
- Larger teams with someone always available
- Office-based businesses where staff can answer

But for small businesses where the owner is also the technician, the salesperson, and the service provider? A VoIP system is just a more expensive version of the same problem.

You're on a ladder installing shingles. Your phone rings with an emergency leak call. The VoIP system routes it to your mobile phone. But you still can't answeryou're 20 feet up with a nail gun in your hand.

The call goes to voicemail. The customer calls the next roofer. You lose a $6,500 job.

Having the best VoIP technology doesn't matter if there's nobody there to pick up.

## Beyond VoIP: The AI Receptionist Alternative

### What is an AI Receptionist?

An AI receptionist is fundamentally different from a phone system. Instead of providing the technology for humans to make and receive calls, it actually answers the calls for you.

Think of it as hiring a receptionist who:
- Never takes a sick day
- Never goes on vacation
- Works 24/7, including weekends and holidays
- Answers in under 5 seconds, every single time
- Never puts a customer on hold
- Costs a fraction of a human receptionist or traditional answering service

The AI is trained on your specific businessyour services, pricing, availability, and common questions. When a call comes in, the AI engages in a natural conversation with the caller.

### How It's Different from VoIP Systems

VoIP systems provide the rails for communication. AI receptionists provide the solution.

**VoIP System:**
- Gives you a phone number and calling features
- Routes calls to your devices
- Still requires you to answer
- Per-user pricing model
- Calls go to voicemail when you're unavailable

**AI Receptionist:**
- Answers every call for you
- Handles routine questions immediately
- Routes urgent calls to your phone
- Flat monthly pricing
- Zero missed calls, ever

According to [research on the evolution from VoIP to AI](https://www.bland.ai/blogs/transition-from-voip-to-ai), traditional VoIP frameworks' limitations in automation, scalability, and intelligent response handling have led to the rise of AI phone agents.

### The Hybrid Model: AI + Human Backup

The best approach isn't AI versus humanit's AI plus human.

Here's how it works:

**For routine inquiries (95% of calls):**
- "What are your hours?" � AI answers immediately
- "How much do you charge for X?" � AI provides pricing
- "Can you come Tuesday at 2 PM?" � AI checks calendar and books appointment
- "I'd like a quote" � AI collects details, schedules callback, creates CRM lead

**For urgent or complex situations (5% of calls):**
- "We have a pipe burst flooding the basement!" � AI recognizes emergency, transfers immediately to your cell phone
- "I have a question about the estimate you sent" � AI transfers to you for detailed discussion

The AI handles the volume. You handle the situations that actually need your expertise.

### Workflow Integration (Closing the Loop)

Here's where AI receptionists really shine compared to VoIP systems: they don't just answer calls, they complete workflows.

When a VoIP system takes a message, someone needs to:
1. Listen to voicemail
2. Manually create a CRM lead
3. Remember to call back
4. Schedule a follow-up if needed

80% of the time, those callbacks never happen.

When an AI receptionist takes a call:
1. Automatically logs all details to your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
2. Sends an SMS to the caller with next steps or booking link
3. Schedules appointments directly in your calendar
4. Routes emergency calls to your phone immediately
5. Sends you an email summary with transcript and recording

The loop is closed automatically. Nothing falls through the cracks.

For example: A homeowner calls your plumbing business at 9 PM asking for an emergency visit. The AI determines it's not a true emergency (slow drain, not burst pipe), collects their information, schedules a callback for 8 AM the next morning, sends them a confirmation SMS, and creates a lead in your CRMall while you're asleep.

You wake up to a perfectly qualified lead, ready to call back at the scheduled time.

## How NextPhone Replaces Your Phone System

### How It Works

NextPhone is an AI-first alternative to traditional phone systems. Instead of giving you the tools to answer calls, it answers them for you.

When you sign up:
1. You provide information about your business (services, pricing, hours)
2. The AI is trained on your specific business
3. You forward your existing number or get a new one
4. Calls start being answered immediately

The AI picks up in under 5 seconds. It understands natural language, so callers can speak normallyno awkward phone tree navigation.

### Key Features for Small Businesses

**24/7 Call Answering:**
Every call is answered in under 5 seconds, whether it's 2 PM on Tuesday or 2 AM on Sunday. No more "Sorry, we're closed" voicemails.

**Emergency Detection and Routing:**
The AI is trained to recognize urgent situations (pipe burst, power outage, AC failure in extreme heat) and immediately transfer those calls to your cell phone while keeping the customer on the line.

**CRM Auto-Logging:**
Every call is automatically logged to your CRM (HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive, Zoho, or custom webhook). No manual data entry.

**SMS Follow-Ups:**
The AI can send text messages to callers with booking links, confirmation details, or answers to their questions.

**Appointment Scheduling:**
Integration with Calendly or other calendar tools allows the AI to book appointments directly based on your availability.

**Call Recording and Transcripts:**
Every call is recorded and transcribed. You get email notifications with summaries, so you can review conversations and ensure quality.

### Pricing: Flat Fee vs Per-User

Here's where the economics get interesting.

**Nextiva Professional Plan:**
- $36 per user per month
- 3 users = $108/month
- 5 users = $180/month
- Plus you still miss calls when everyone is busy

**RingCentral/Dialpad/Similar:**
- $25-$45 per user per month
- Similar scaling costs
- Still requires humans to answer

**NextPhone:**
- $199 per month flat
- Unlimited calls
- Zero missed calls
- No per-user fees
- No additional costs

For a solo operator, NextPhone costs $199 versus $36 for Nextiva. But you capture 31 additional calls per month that would have gone to voicemail.

For a team of 5, you're paying $199 versus $180 for Nextivaand you're capturing every single call, not just the ones when someone happens to be available.

### Real ROI Calculation

Let's use real numbers from our study:

**Lost Revenue (Current State):**
- 42 calls per month (industry average for small contractors)
- 74.1% missed = 31 calls unanswered
- Conservative 20% conversion rate = 6.2 jobs
- $3,500 average project value
- **$21,700 per month in lost revenue**
- **$260,400 per year**

**NextPhone Cost:**
- $199/month
- $2,388/year

**Net Gain:**
- $260,400 lost revenue captured - $2,388 cost = **$257,612 per year**
- That's a 10,758% ROI

Even if your conversion rate is only 10% instead of 20%, you're still capturing $130,200 in annual revenue for a $2,388 investment.

One HVAC contractor in our data went from 31 missed calls per month to zero after implementing an AI receptionist. He closed 6 additional jobs per month on average$25,200 in additional revenue monthly, or $302,400 annually.

His comment: "I didn't realize I was turning away a quarter million dollars a year by not answering my phone."

## Choosing the Right Alternative for Your Business

### Choose VoIP If...

A VoIP alternative to Nextiva makes sense if:

- **You have dedicated staff to answer calls.** If you have a receptionist or team members available during business hours, a VoIP system gives them better tools.

- **You need enterprise features.** Multi-region operations, complex call routing, department-level analyticsthese are VoIP strengths.

- **Team collaboration is a priority.** Video meetings, team chat, file sharing, and unified communications shine for office-based teams.

- **You're a larger organization.** Once you have 15+ employees with different roles, a full unified communications platform makes sense.

### Choose AI Receptionist If...

An AI receptionist is the better choice if:

- **You're solo or small team (1-10 people).** You don't need per-user licensesyou need someone to answer the phone.

- **You work on job sites or in the field.** Contractors, tradespeople, mobile service providersanyone who physically can't answer while working.

- **You get after-hours calls.** Emergency services, urgent requests, or customers in different time zones calling outside 9-5.

- **You're losing revenue to missed calls.** If you're missing 20+ calls per month, an AI receptionist pays for itself immediately.

- **You want to eliminate per-user costs.** One flat fee covers unlimited calls, no matter how many people are on your team.

### Questions to Ask Yourself

**What percentage of our calls are we missing?**
If you don't know, you're probably missing more than you think. Our data shows the average is 74.1%, but some contractors were missing over 90%.

**Do we have someone dedicated to answering calls?**
If the answer is noif the owner, technician, or salesperson is also the receptionistyou need someone (or something) to answer.

**What's our after-hours call volume?**
In our study, 73% of emergency calls came outside business hours. If you're in a field where emergencies happen (plumbing, HVAC, electrical, roofing), after-hours coverage is critical.

**What's more important: phone features or captured revenue?**
VoIP systems offer lots of features (video, chat, collaboration tools). AI receptionists offer one thing: answered calls. Which one solves your actual problem?

For example: A 5-person contractor team on Nextiva at $36/user pays $180/month. They still miss 70% of calls because everyone is on job sites. They switch to NextPhone at $199/month and capture every call. They're paying $19 more per month but capturing an additional $20,000+ in monthly revenue.

That's not even a close decision.

## Frequently Asked Questions About Nextiva Alternatives

### What is the cheapest alternative to Nextiva?

Zoom Phone starts at $15 per user for basic calling features, making it the most affordable traditional VoIP alternative to Nextiva.

However, "cheapest" isn't always the best value. You need to calculate the total cost including lost revenue from missed calls.

NextPhone costs $199/month flat, which may seem more expensive than Nextiva at $36/user. But if you have 6 or more users, NextPhone is actually cheaper ($199 vs $216+). And more importantly, you're capturing calls that would otherwise go to voicemail.

The real cost of Nextiva isn't the $36/monthit's the $260,400/year in missed calls.

For a detailed breakdown of costs and features, check out our [pricing page](/pricing).

### Can AI really answer my business calls?

Modern AI achieves 85-95% accuracy for routine business inquiries. The key is training the AI on your specific businessyour services, pricing, hours, and common questions.

In our analysis of 13,175 calls, AI could handle approximately 95% of inquiries without human intervention. That includes:
- Hours and availability questions
- Pricing inquiries
- Service descriptions
- Appointment scheduling
- Quote requests
- General information

The AI routes complex or unusual questions to you. For example, if someone asks about a unique situation ("Can you install a water heater in a crawl space with only 3 feet of clearance?"), the AI will transfer to you for expert consultation.

Learn more about [how NextPhone's AI works](/how-it-works).

### How hard is it to switch from Nextiva?

For VoIP alternatives (RingCentral, Dialpad, etc.), you can typically port your number within 1-3 weeks. Most providers handle the technical details of porting.

For AI receptionist services like NextPhone, it's even simpler: You can forward your existing Nextiva number to the AI, and calls start being answered immediately. No waiting for number porting.

Most migrations to either VoIP alternatives or AI receptionists are completed within 7 days.

### Will I lose my phone number if I switch?

No. Number porting is standard practice for all alternatives.

VoIP providers like RingCentral, Dialpad, 8x8, and Zoom Phone all handle number porting from Nextiva. The process typically takes 1-3 weeks and requires your account information and a Letter of Authorization.

AI receptionists can work with your existing number in two ways:
1. **Call forwarding:** Forward your Nextiva number to the AI (starts working immediately)
2. **Number porting:** Port your number away from Nextiva to the AI service (1-3 weeks)

You keep your business number either way.

### What about after-hours calls?

This is where VoIP systems and AI receptionists differ dramatically.

**With VoIP systems** (Nextiva, RingCentral, Dialpad, etc.):
- Calls after business hours go to voicemail
- You can set up after-hours routing to cell phones
- But someone still needs to be available to answer

**With AI receptionist** (NextPhone):
- Calls are answered 24/7, every day of the year
- No holidays, no weekends, no "closed" hours
- Emergency calls are routed to your cell immediately
- Routine calls are handled by AI and scheduled for follow-up

In our data, 73% of true emergency calls happened outside standard business hours. For industries like plumbing, HVAC, electrical, or emergency services, missing an after-hours call means losing the highest-value jobs.

Emergency jobs average $4,200 in our studysignificantly higher than routine work. Missing just one emergency call per week costs $16,800 per month in lost revenue.

### Do I still need a business phone number?

Yes, you still need a phone number for customers to call. The question is what happens when they call that number.

**VoIP alternatives** provide virtual phone numbers (or port your existing one) and give you the technology to make and receive calls.

**AI receptionists** work with your existing business number (either by forwarding or porting) and answer calls on that number.

In both cases, you keep your business phone number. The difference is whether a VoIP system routes the call to a human who may or may not be available, or an AI that's always available.

### How much does it cost to switch?

**VoIP alternatives (RingCentral, Dialpad, etc.):**
- Most providers: No setup fees with annual contracts
- Month-to-month plans may have $10-30 per user setup fees
- One-time number porting fee: Usually free to $25

**AI receptionist (NextPhone):**
- Typically no setup fees
- Monthly subscription only ($199/month for NextPhone)
- Number forwarding is immediate and free
- Number porting may have carrier fees ($25-50)

**Don't forget early termination fees:**
If you're under contract with Nextiva, you may face early termination fees. Check your contract before switching. However, given the revenue impact of missed calls ($260,400/year on average), the cost to break your contract is often worth it.

Many businesses find that the revenue captured from answered calls in the first month more than covers any switching costs.

---

## Stop Paying for Missed Calls

You have plenty of good VoIP alternatives to Nextiva. RingCentral, Dialpad, 8x8, and Zoom Phone all offer solid features at comparable or lower pricing.

If you have dedicated staff to answer calls and need enterprise collaboration features, those VoIP alternatives make sense.

But for small businessesespecially those working in the field, on job sites, or providing after-hours servicesswitching from one VoIP system to another doesn't solve the core problem.

The real issue isn't which phone system you use. The issue is who answers the calls.

In our analysis of 13,175 calls, 74.1% went completely unanswered. For a typical contractor, that's $260,400 per year in lost revenuewalking out the door because nobody picked up the phone.

An AI receptionist costs $199 per month. If it captures even 10% of those missed opportunities, it pays for itself 50 times over.

You don't need more phone features. You need someoneor somethingto answer every single call, 24/7, in under 5 seconds, and close the loop by logging details to your CRM and scheduling follow-ups.

That's not a phone system. That's an AI receptionist.
