## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- 74.1% missed calls ’ Use in: Problem statement (intro section)
- 25.4% callbacks ’ Use in: Why calendar sync matters (callbacks need scheduling)
- 15.9% urgency ’ Use in: Emergency routing + calendar section
- 7.7% scheduling requests ’ Use in: Main problem section (191 out of 2,487 calls are scheduling)
- 13,175 calls analyzed from 47 customers over 7 months ’ Use in: Throughout for credibility

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls ’ Use in: Problem section
2. Real customer scenarios from factbase ’ Use in: Use cases section

**Industry Examples:**
- **HVAC (2 customers):** Can't answer while on ladders, summer peak season call surges, emergency calls (AC out in 95° heat)
- **Plumbing (3 customers):** Under houses, hands dirty, emergency calls (pipe burst), after-hours common
- **Electrical (5 customers):** In attics/crawl spaces, safety prevents answering, emergency calls (power out)
- **General Contractors (19 customers):** On job sites, hands dirty, estimate requests while in field

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls/month
- 7.7% scheduling requests = ~3 appointment booking calls/month going unanswered
- If 20% convert at $3,500 average = **$21,700/mo lost** = **$260,400/year**
- NextPhone cost: $199/mo = **ROI: 10,900%**

**Emergency Call Economics:**
- 15.9% urgent calls = ~7 urgent calls/month for 42-call/month business
- Emergency jobs average $4,200 (higher than routine)
- Missing 1 emergency/week = $16,800/mo lost = $201,600/year
