### SECTION 2: The Hidden Cost of Missed Scheduling Calls

**Purpose:** Quantify the problem with revenue impact calculations
**Word Count Target:** 350-400 words

**H3 Subsections:**
1. How Many Scheduling Calls Are You Missing?
2. The Revenue Math
3. Why Service Businesses Miss Appointment Requests

**Key Points to Cover:**
- 7.7% of calls = scheduling requests (not counting general inquiries that COULD lead to bookings)
- For typical contractor with 42 calls/month: 3-4 scheduling calls/month
- If 74.1% missed, that's 2-3 lost appointment bookings monthly
- Revenue impact: 3 appointments × $3,500 average = $10,500/month = $126,000/year
- Why missed: In field, on ladders, hands dirty, safety regulations, under houses, in attics
- After-hours calls: Many customers call evenings/weekends to book

**Data/Stats to Include:**
- **Stat 1:** "42 calls/month average for contractors" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Stat 2:** "74.1% missed" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Stat 3:** "7.7% explicit scheduling requests" - Source: NextPhone factbase
- **Calculation:** "42 calls × 7.7% scheduling = 3.2 scheduling calls/month. At 74.1% missed rate = 2.4 lost bookings/month × $3,500 = $8,400/month or $100,800/year"

**Examples/Quotes:**
- Quote: "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls
- Example: HVAC contractor during summer peak season, call volume spikes, misses appointments
