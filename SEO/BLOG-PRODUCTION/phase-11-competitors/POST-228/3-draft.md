You got Grasshopper because you needed a business number that wasn't your personal cell.

It made sense. Professional-sounding number. Separate voicemail. Extensions if you ever needed them. $25 a month felt reasonable for legitimacy.

Now your business is growing. You're getting 10, 20, 30 calls a week. And you're missing half of them because you're on a roof, under a house, or meeting with a client.

Grasshopper takes voicemails. But voicemails don't capture leadsthey just delay them until the customer calls someone else.

Here's how to upgrade from basic virtual number to intelligent answering without changing the number your customers already know.

## Why Entrepreneurs Choose Grasshopper

Grasshopper hit the right notes for entrepreneurs starting out:

**Separate business line.** No more giving customers your personal cell. A dedicated business number looks professional.

**Simple pricing.** Solo plan at $14/month, Partner at $25/month. Predictable, affordable, easy to justify.

**Basic call features.** Voicemail, extensions, call forwarding, business hours settings. The fundamentals.

**Mobile app.** Answer business calls from anywhere without revealing your personal number.

For someone doing their first few jobs each month, Grasshopper handles the basics.

## Where Grasshopper Falls Short

As call volume increases, Grasshopper's limitations emerge:

### Voicemail-Only Answering

When you miss a call, Grasshopper sends it to voicemail. That's the extent of the "answering." In our study of 13,175 calls, 74.1% went unansweredfor Grasshopper users, that means 74% voicemails at best.

Callers don't like leaving voicemails. They want to talk to someone or book somethingnow.

### No Intelligence

Grasshopper can't distinguish between "I want to schedule an estimate" and "My basement is flooding." Both get the same generic voicemail.

No urgency detection. No routing based on caller needs. No handling of routine questions.

### 30-Day Voicemail Limit

Grasshopper deletes voicemails after 30 days. Miss that callback? The lead is gone permanently.

### Limited Integrations

Grasshopper doesn't connect to CRMs, scheduling tools, or other business software. Every lead requires manual entryif you remember to do it.

### No Real Answering

Extensions route calls, but someone still has to answer. If you're working, the phone goes to voicemail. Grasshopper is a phone system, not an answering solution.

## The Ruby Receptionist Problem

Grasshopper partners with Ruby Receptionists for human answering. The problem? Cost.

Ruby's pricing starts at $245/month for 50 receptionist minutes. At 2 minutes per call, that covers 25 calls. Go over? You're paying $3.15-4.95 per additional minute.

A contractor getting 100 calls monthly could easily spend $600-800/month on Rubyfor the answering service alone, on top of Grasshopper's fee.

For a solo entrepreneur who chose Grasshopper specifically because it was affordable, Ruby's pricing doesn't fit the budget.

## AI Receptionist: The Affordable Upgrade

AI receptionist bridges the gap between Grasshopper's voicemail and Ruby's premium pricing.

**What AI provides:**

- **Answers calls conversationally:** Not voicemail, not button menusreal conversation
- **24/7 availability:** Same quality at midnight as noon
- **Routine call handling:** Hours, pricing, scheduling, basic questions
- **Emergency routing:** Urgent calls go to your phone immediately
- **Flat-rate pricing:** $199/month unlimitedno per-minute anxiety

**Comparison:**

| Feature | Grasshopper (Voicemail) | Ruby Receptionist | AI Receptionist |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Answers calls | No | Yes | Yes |
| 24/7 coverage | No (voicemail) | Limited hours | Yes |
| Emergency routing | No | Script-based | Automatic |
| Monthly cost | $14-80 | $245+ for 50 min | $199 unlimited |
| Per-minute fees | None | $3.15-4.95/min | None |

## Keep Your Grasshopper Number

You don't have to abandon your established number to upgrade:

### Simple Call Forwarding

Grasshopper supports conditional call forwarding. When you don't answer, calls forward to your AI number.

1. In Grasshopper settings, go to Extensions ’ Your Extension
2. Set "If Unanswered" to forward to your AI phone number
3. Configure ring count before forwarding (typically 4 rings)
4. Save settings

Callers dial your Grasshopper number. If you don't pick up, AI answers.

### Number Stays the Same

Your number on business cards, trucks, websitesall stays the same. Customers call the same number. You just answer better.

### Port Later If Desired

Once comfortable, you can port your Grasshopper number directly to an AI service. But there's no rushforwarding works indefinitely.

## Cost Comparison

| Scenario | Monthly Cost | What You Get |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Grasshopper only | $25 | Voicemail, missed calls |
| Grasshopper + Ruby (50 min) | $25 + $245 = $270 | 25-50 answered calls |
| Grasshopper + AI | $25 + $199 = $224 | Unlimited answered calls, 24/7 |

For $46/month less than Grasshopper + Ruby, you get unlimited AI answering instead of 50 minutes.

**ROI calculation:**

If AI captures just 1 extra job per month that you'd have missed (customer who would have called someone else instead of leaving voicemail):

- Average job: $3,500
- AI cost: $199
- Return: 17x investment

## Setup Guide

### Step 1: Get AI Service

Sign up for an AI receptionist. You'll receive a dedicated phone number.

### Step 2: Configure AI

Enter your business details, services, hours, and common questions. Set up emergency routing to your cell.

### Step 3: Set Up Grasshopper Forwarding

In Grasshopper:

1. Go to Settings ’ Extensions ’ Your extension
2. Under "If the caller reaches voicemail," select "Forward to phone"
3. Enter your AI phone number
4. Save

Alternatively, under "Call Forwarding":
1. Add your AI number as a forwarding destination
2. Set forwarding conditions (when unanswered, when busy)
3. Save

### Step 4: Test

Call your Grasshopper number. Don't answer. Verify AI picks up, answers correctly, and routes test emergencies to your cell.

Total setup: 20-30 minutes.

## FAQ

### Can I keep my Grasshopper number?

Yes. Configure Grasshopper to forward unanswered calls to AI. Your number stays the sameon cards, trucks, websites. Only the answering improves.

### What about Grasshopper's texting feature?

Keep using Grasshopper for SMS. AI handles voice calls. They work independently.

### Is $199/month worth it if I'm just starting out?

If you're missing calls that would become jobs, yes. One captured job per month at $3,500 returns 17x the $199 investment. If you're getting 2-3 calls per week, voicemail might still work. If you're getting 10+, you're losing business.

### How does AI handle emergency calls?

AI detects urgency language ("emergency," "flooding," "urgent") and immediately routes to your phone. You get the critical calls; AI handles the routine ones.

### Can I turn off forwarding when I'm available?

Yes. Disable forwarding in Grasshopper settings when you want to answer calls yourself. Re-enable when you're working and can't answer.

## Time to Outgrow Voicemail

Grasshopper got you started. Professional number, basic features, affordable price.

But as your business grows, voicemail stops being good enough. Customers calling and reaching voicemail often call someone else instead.

AI receptionist is the upgrade: professional answering at $199/month, keeping your established number, with capabilities that capture every call.

You've outgrown voicemail. Ready to answer every call? Try NextPhone with your Grasshopper number14 days free.
