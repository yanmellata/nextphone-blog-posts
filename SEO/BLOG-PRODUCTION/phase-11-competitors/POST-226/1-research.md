## 1.3 USER INTENT & REAL QUESTIONS

### Nextiva User Complaints (from research):

**Auto Attendant/IVR Issues:**
- "The dial numbers and lines were not connected properly, causing customers to be directed to the incorrect lines"
- "You can't see which extensions belong to which groups or how users route through auto-attendants and phone trees. Auditing the system or tracing call paths becomes an archaeological dig every single time"
- "Currently has no functioning voicemail and no automated attendant, despite my requests for assistance"
- "Call quality is consistently poor, with frequent drops, delays, and echoes making communication virtually impossible"

**Customer Experience Pain Points:**
- Customers frustrated with menu-based IVR ("press 1 for sales, 2 for support")
- Long hold times during call trees
- Callers getting routed to wrong department
- After-hours calls going straight to generic voicemail
- No way to handle multiple locations with different needs

**Real User Concerns:**
1. "Will I have to change my phone number?" (NO - call forwarding keeps existing number)
2. "Is this expensive to set up?" (Simple forwarding setup, no hardware)
3. "What happens to my existing Nextiva features?" (Keep everything, AI is additive)
4. "Can I use both systems together?" (YES - that's the whole point)
5. "Will my Nextiva contract be affected?" (No, this is third-party integration)
6. "How do I route emergencies differently?" (AI detects urgency, forwards immediately)

**Use Cases Mentioned:**
- Contractor on job site, can't answer during work
- Multi-location businesses needing different handling per location
- After-hours coverage without hiring night staff
- Overflow during busy seasons (roofing after storms, HVAC in summer)
- Branch offices that need AI while main office keeps receptionist

## 1.5 INTERNAL DATA (NextPhone Factbase)

**Core Stats:**
- **74.1% missed calls** → Use in: Opening hook, problem section
- **25.4% callback requests** → Use in: IVR limitation section (callbacks fall through cracks)
- **15.9% urgency language** → Use in: Emergency routing section
- **6.2% true emergencies** → Use in: Why AI detection matters (route to human immediately)
- **$260,400/year lost revenue** → Use in: ROI calculation section

**Customer Quotes:**
1. "I didn't even know I was missing that many calls until I saw the data. I just thought business was slow." - Plumber with 76 missed calls/month → Use in: Problem awareness section
2. Customer quote about preferring AI over slow answering services → Use in: AI benefits section

**Industry Examples:**
- **Roofing (6 customers):** Can't answer phone while on roof installing shingles, storm season creates call spikes
- **Electrical (5 customers):** In attics/crawl spaces can't reach phone, safety regs prevent answering during work
- **Plumbing (3 customers):** Under houses fixing pipes hands dirty, after-hours emergencies common (2 AM burst pipes)
- **HVAC (2 customers):** On ladders installing units, summer/winter peak seasons surge calls

**ROI Calculations:**
- 42 calls/mo × 74.1% missed = 31 missed calls
- 31 missed × 20% conversion × $3,500 avg job = **$21,700/mo lost = $260,400/year lost**
- NextPhone cost: **$199/mo** ($2,388/year)
- ROI: **10,900%** (saves $258,012 net)

**Nextiva-Specific Calculation:**
- Nextiva base plan: ~$30-40/user/mo
- XBert AI add-on: $99/mo + $0.99/call
- At 42 calls/mo: $99 + ($0.99 × 42) = $99 + $41.58 = **$140.58/mo**
- NextPhone: **$199/mo unlimited** (better value for high-volume)
- Plus: Keep existing Nextiva for other features, don't lose investment

**How to Cite:**
✅ "In our analysis of 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months..."

1. **More specific to Nextiva users** - Address their actual pain points (not generic)
2. **More data-driven** - 13,175 calls analyzed vs generic claims
3. **More transparent pricing** - Show all costs vs hiding pricing
4. **Better positioning** - Integration partner vs "switch away" or "buy our thing"
