Your phone rings. You're under a house fixing a pipe. The customer hears ringing. Then voicemail. They hang up and call the next plumber.

We analyzed 13,175 calls from 47 home services contractors over 7 months. The data is brutal: 74.1% of calls went completely unanswered. For a contractor receiving 42 calls per month, that's 31 missed calls. If even 20% would have converted at $3,500 average project value, that's $21,700 per month in lost revenue$260,400 per year.

An answering service fixes this. But which one?

This comparison covers four leading human answering servicesAbby Connect, VoiceNation, Specialty Answering Service, and Posh Virtual Receptionistsplus AI receptionist as a fifth option. We'll show real pricing, actual features, and help you decide which fits your business.

Full disclosure: We make an AI receptionist (NextPhone). We'll try to be fair in this comparison, but you should know our perspective.

## Why Answering Services Matter

Before comparing specific services, let's understand what's at stake.

Our call data reveals three critical patterns:

**Most calls go unanswered.** 74.1% of calls in our study reached voicemail or rang out. Contractors can't answer while on ladders, under houses, or working with power tools. The phone rings; the opportunity dies.

**Urgent calls are high-value.** 15.9% of calls contained urgency language"emergency," "urgent," "ASAP," "pipe burst," "no power." These emergency jobs average $4,200, significantly higher than routine work. Missing one emergency call per week costs $16,800 monthly.

**Callbacks fall through cracks.** 25.4% of callers explicitly requested callbacks. Without a system to track these requests, most never get returned.

Any answering servicehuman or AIdramatically outperforms voicemail. The question is which service delivers the best value for your specific situation.

## Abby Connect

**Overview:** Abby Connect takes a unique approach: instead of rotating receptionists, you get a dedicated team of 5 receptionists who learn your business. Based in Las Vegas, they've built a reputation for consistency and personalization.

**Pricing:**

- Base plans start at $299/month
- $95 one-time setup fee
- Per-call pricing after plan limit
- Add-ons for extended hours

**Coverage:**

- Standard hours: 8am-8pm (Monday-Friday)
- Weekend and after-hours coverage requires additional fees
- Not true 24/7 in base plan

**Features:**

- Dedicated 5-person receptionist team
- Integration with Clio, HubSpot, Salesforce
- Custom call scripting
- Appointment scheduling
- Bilingual options available

**Best For:** Businesses that value consistencyhaving the same receptionists who know your clients by name. Law firms and professional services often prefer this model.

**Limitations:** The 8am-8pm coverage leaves evenings and weekends uncovered unless you pay extra. For contractors who receive emergency calls at 10 PM, this creates gaps.

## VoiceNation

**Overview:** VoiceNation offers true 24/7 human answering with per-minute pricing. Based in Buford, Georgia, they've served businesses since 2002.

**Pricing:**

- 100 minutes: $229/month
- Overage: $2.19 per minute
- No setup fees
- Month-to-month available

**Coverage:**

- True 24/7 live answering
- Holidays included, no extra charge
- Bilingual (English/Spanish)

**Features:**

- Custom call scripts
- Message delivery via text, email, or app
- Appointment scheduling
- Call patching to your cell
- Online dashboard for call management

**Best For:** Businesses needing genuine round-the-clock coverage with moderate call volume. If you receive 50-80 calls monthly and need night/weekend coverage, VoiceNation offers good value.

**Limitations:** Per-minute pricing creates unpredictability. A busy month with longer calls can spike your bill unexpectedly. At 200 calls with 2-minute averages, you're looking at $400+ just in overage fees.

## Specialty Answering Service (SAS)

**Overview:** With 35+ years in business, SAS brings deep experience and industry-specific knowledge. They've developed scripting protocols for dozens of industries, from medical practices to HVAC contractors.

**Pricing:**

- 100 minutes: $159/month
- Pay-as-you-go: $44/month + $1.54/minute
- Flexible pricing options
- Month-to-month contracts

**Coverage:**

- 24/7 live answering
- Bilingual support
- Holiday coverage included

**Features:**

- Industry-specific call scripts (legal, medical, trades)
- HIPAA-compliant options for healthcare
- Appointment scheduling
- Message delivery (text, email, fax)
- On-call scheduling for emergency dispatch

**Best For:** Established businesses with specific call handling protocols. Medical practices needing HIPAA compliance. Contractors wanting industry-trained receptionists.

**Limitations:** The dual pricing structure (monthly minutes vs pay-as-you-go) can be confusing. Lower per-minute rates than competitors, but costs still scale with volume.

## Posh Virtual Receptionists

**Overview:** Posh positions itself as a boutique, premium service. Based in Virginia Beach, they emphasize personalized attention and high-touch customer experience.

**Pricing:**

- Base: $65/month minimum
- Per-minute: $2.25
- No long-term contracts
- Custom pricing for high-volume

**Coverage:**

- Business hours focus
- Extended hours available
- Not inherently 24/7

**Features:**

- Premium, personalized service
- Detailed call summaries
- Integration with practice management software
- Appointment scheduling
- Custom greetings and scripts

**Best For:** Professional services firms (lawyers, accountants, consultants) wanting a polished, boutique feel. Businesses where every call represents a high-value client.

**Limitations:** Per-minute pricing adds up quickly at volume. The $2.25/minute rate means 100 minutes of calls costs $225plus the $65 base. Limited 24/7 options.

## AI Receptionist: The Fifth Option

While human answering services dominated for decades, AI receptionist technology has matured into a genuine alternative.

**Overview:** AI receptionists use natural language processing to answer calls conversationally. They're not the robotic "press 1 for sales" IVR systemsthey understand questions like "Can you fit me in tomorrow afternoon?" and respond naturally.

**Typical Pricing:**

- Flat rate: $150-300/month for unlimited calls
- No per-minute charges
- No overage fees
- No night/weekend premiums

**Coverage:**

- True 24/7 (AI doesn't sleep)
- Holidays included
- Same performance at 3 AM as 3 PM

**Features:**

- Answers in under 5 seconds (faster than any human service)
- Handles routine calls: hours, pricing, scheduling, quote requests
- Detects urgency keywords and routes emergencies to your phone
- CRM integration (automatic lead logging)
- SMS follow-ups with booking links
- Call transcripts and summaries
- Callback tracking

**Best For:** High-volume businesses (100+ calls/month) seeking predictable costs. Contractors who need 24/7 coverage for emergencies. Businesses where most calls are routine inquiries.

**Limitations:** Complex calls requiring human judgmentdetailed legal intake, sensitive medical triage, high-stakes sales negotiationsmay still benefit from human touch. AI routes these to humans rather than handling poorly.

## Complete Comparison Table

Here's how all five options stack up:

| Feature | Abby Connect | VoiceNation | SAS | Posh | AI Receptionist |
|---------|--------------|-------------|-----|------|-----------------|
| Base Price | $299/mo | $229/100min | $159/100min | $65+$2.25/min | $199/mo unlimited |

| Emergency Routing | Script-based | Script-based | Script-based | Script-based | Automatic detection |
| CRM Integration | Clio, HubSpot | Limited | Limited | Some | Automatic |

**Cost at Different Volumes (2-minute average call duration):**

| Monthly Calls | Abby Connect | VoiceNation | SAS | AI Receptionist |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-----|-----------------|
| 50 calls | ~$299 | ~$229 | ~$159 | $199 |
| 100 calls | ~$350 | ~$449 | ~$318 | $199 |
| 200 calls | ~$450 | ~$888 | ~$636 | $199 |
| 300 calls | ~$550 | ~$1,327 | ~$954 | $199 |

At 50 calls, costs are similar across options. At 100+, per-minute services become significantly more expensive than flat-rate AI.

## How to Choose the Right Service

Your best choice depends on three factors:

### Factor 1: Call Volume

**Under 50 calls/month:** Human services and AI cost roughly the same. Choose based on other factors.

**50-100 calls/month:** AI starts showing cost advantages. Consider switching if cost matters.

**100+ calls/month:** AI dramatically cheaper. Hard to justify per-minute pricing unless you specifically need human judgment on every call.

### Factor 2: Coverage Needs

**Business hours only:** Any service works. Abby Connect's dedicated team model shines here.

**True 24/7:** VoiceNation, SAS, or AI. Avoid services that charge night/weekend premiums.

**Emergency-heavy industries:** AI's automatic urgency detection edges out script-based human services.

### Factor 3: Call Complexity

**Mostly routine (hours, scheduling, pricing):** AI handles these perfectly. No reason to pay per-minute for simple calls.

**Complex intake (legal, medical):** Human services may be worth the premium. SAS has industry-specific expertise.

**High-touch relationship sales:** Abby Connect's dedicated team approach may justify the cost.

**Quick Decision Framework:**

- Choose **Abby Connect** if: You want the same receptionists every time and work standard business hours
- Choose **VoiceNation** if: You need true 24/7 with moderate volume (under 80 calls/month)
- Choose **SAS** if: You need industry-specific scripting and HIPAA compliance
- Choose **Posh** if: You want boutique service and have low call volume
- Choose **AI** if: You handle 100+ calls, need 24/7, want predictable costs, and most calls are routine

## How NextPhone Fits In

**What makes it different:**

- **$199/month unlimited:** No per-minute charges, no overage fees, no contracts
- **Under 5 seconds:** Faster pickup than any human service

We're biased, obviously. But the math is the math.

## FAQ

### Which answering service is cheapest overall?

At low volume (under 50 calls), costs are similar$150-300/month. At high volume (100+ calls), AI receptionist is dramatically cheaper. A contractor handling 200 calls/month pays ~$199 with AI versus $600-900 with per-minute services.

### Can AI actually handle complex calls?

AI excels at routine callshours, pricing, scheduling, quote requests. For complex intake (legal, medical triage), AI routes to humans rather than attempting to answer. The best AI systems know their limits.

### What about bilingual support?

VoiceNation and SAS include bilingual (English/Spanish) support. Abby Connect offers it as an add-on. Most AI services support multiple languages, though quality varies.

### How quickly can I set up a new answering service?

Human services typically require 3-7 days for script development and training. AI setup can happen in hoursconfigure your business details, set up call forwarding, and you're live.

### Can I try before committing to a contract?

Most services offer trials. VoiceNation and SAS are month-to-month. NextPhone offers 14-day free trials. Abby Connect may require commitments. Always ask.

### What about handling busy season overflow?

This is where AI shines. Per-minute services punish you during busy periodsmore calls means higher bills. AI stays flat. A roofer handling 300 calls during storm season pays the same $199 as during slow months.

## Start Capturing Every Call

Missing 74.1% of calls costs contractors $260,400 annually in lost revenue. Any answering servicehuman or AIdramatically improves this.

For high-volume contractors wanting predictable costs, 24/7 coverage, and instant answer times, AI receptionist makes compelling financial sense.
