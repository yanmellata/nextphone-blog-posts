### SECTION 11: FAQ

**H2 Title:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Purpose:** Address remaining objections and questions
**Word Count Target:** 350-400 words (6 questions × ~60 words each)

**FAQ Questions:**

1. **Is AI really as good as Ruby's human receptionists?**
   - Answer: For straightforward calls (quotes, scheduling, FAQs), modern AI matches or exceeds human quality with perfect consistency. Ruby's humans win on complex screening and empathy. If 80%+ of your calls are routine, AI handles them excellently. The 20% that need human judgment can transfer to you directly.

2. **How much does Ruby Receptionists cost per month?**
   - Answer: Ruby uses per-call and per-minute pricing, so costs vary by volume. User reports indicate $280-350 for 50 calls/month, $500-650 for 100 calls, and $700-900 for 200 calls. After-hours and weekends cost more. Ruby doesn't publish exact per-call rates publicly, making cost prediction difficult.

3. **What's the biggest advantage of AI over Ruby?**
   - Answer: Cost predictability and scale. NextPhone costs $199/month whether you get 50 calls or 500. Ruby's per-call model means your bill fluctuates with volume. During busy months or seasonal surges, AI costs stay flat while Ruby bills spike. Plus, AI handles 100+ simultaneous calls instantly - no capacity limits or hold times.

4. **When should I stick with Ruby instead of switching to AI?**
   - Answer: Stay with Ruby if: (1) You receive fewer than 50-80 calls/month consistently, (2) Your calls require complex multi-step screening that needs human judgment, (3) You're a luxury brand where human touch is part of your image, (4) Budget isn't a constraint. Ruby's human receptionists excel at empathy and unusual scenarios worth paying premium for.

5. **Can I try NextPhone without canceling Ruby first?**
   - Answer: Yes. Run both services in parallel - forward some calls to NextPhone, keep others going to Ruby. Test AI with your actual call types for 1-2 weeks. If satisfied, switch fully. Most customers test AI risk-free during NextPhone's 14-day trial before making final decision.

6. **What happens to complex calls with AI that need human judgment?**
   - Answer: NextPhone AI can transfer calls to you directly when it detects complexity beyond its scope or caller requests to speak to a person. You get the best of both: AI handles 80% of routine calls, transfers the 20% that need your expertise. Unlike Ruby where every call costs you, AI-handled calls are free, human-transferred calls get your personal attention.
