10. When to choose each option

**Content Gaps (OUR OPPORTUNITIES - How We'll Win):**

1. **Gap: No fair, balanced Ruby vs AI comparison**
   - Competitors: Ruby's site is self-promotional, generic directories lack depth
   - We'll do: Acknowledge what Ruby does excellently (complex screening, empathy) AND where AI wins (cost, scale, consistency)

2. **Gap: No real per-call cost math at different volumes**
   - Competitors: Vague "starts at $X/month" without scenarios
   - We'll do: Show actual costs at 50, 100, 200, 500 calls with comparison table

3. **Gap: No switching guide for current Ruby customers**
   - Competitors: Generic selection guides
   - We'll do: "Are you a Ruby customer? Here's when to consider switching" section with decision framework

4. **Gap: No surge capacity explanation**
   - Competitors: Claim "handles high volume" without specifics
   - We'll do: Explain Ruby's human operator limits vs AI handling 100+ simultaneous (storm season, Black Friday scenarios)

5. **Gap: No honesty about when humans beat AI**
   - Competitors: Either all-in on human OR all-in on AI
   - We'll do: Create "When Ruby Wins" and "When AI Wins" sections with specific use cases

6. **Gap: No voice + chat comparison**

**OUR UNIQUE ANGLE:**
> "Fair comparison acknowledging Ruby Receptionists is the gold standard for human answering services with excellent screening capabilities, BUT their per-call pricing model becomes a bottleneck as businesses scale. Show exact cost breakpoints where AI-first makes financial sense (typically 80-100+ calls/month), while honestly stating scenarios where Ruby's human touch is worth the premium (luxury brands, complex B2B sales). Position as 'evolution guide' not 'Ruby is bad'help readers make informed decision based on call volume, budget, and complexity needs."

**How We'll Beat Generic Comparison Posts:**
1. **More honest:** Acknowledge Ruby's genuine strengths, not just bash them
2. **Better data:** Specific cost scenarios with math (50, 100, 200 calls)
3. **Real user insights:** Reddit/forum pain points about cost scaling
4. **Decision framework:** "When to switch" checklist tailored for Ruby customers
5. **Surge scenarios:** Storm season, Black Friday, emergency overflow examples
6. **Balanced positioning:** Not "AI is better" but "AI is better FOR these scenarios"
7. **NextPhone specific:** Show how our $199 flat rate compares at different volumes
