## KEYWORD RESEARCH EXECUTION FRAMEWORK

### Step 1: Seed Keyword Clustering (Per Industry)
For each industry, build 4 keyword tiers:

**Tier A - Core Service Keywords**
- "[Service]" (single word/phrase)
- "[Service] service"
- "[Service] company"

**Tier B - Geo-Local Keywords** (highest volume & intent)
- "[Service] near me"
- "[Service] [city]"
- "[Service] in [city]"
- "[Service] [specific neighborhood]"

**Tier C - Intent Modifiers** (lower volume, higher conversion)
- "best [service] [city]"
- "affordable [service] [city]"
- "emergency [service]"
- "same-day [service]"
- "24-hour [service]"
- "[Service] open now"
- "[Service] appointment"

**Tier D - Specific Service Variants** (long-tail, lowest difficulty)
- "[Specific type] [service] [city]" (e.g., "mobile dog grooming near me," "water damage restoration")
- "[Service] for [condition/scenario]" (e.g., "back pain therapy," "emergency plumbing")
- "[Service] + [question]" (e.g., "how much does [service] cost")

### Step 2: Data Collection Per Keyword
- **Monthly Search Volume** (Google Keyword Planner, Semrush, Ahrefs)
- **Keyword Difficulty** (1–100 scale)
- **CPC/Cost Per Click** (indicates buyer value)
- **Search Intent** (transactional = immediate booking; informational = pre-qualified lead)
- **Trend Direction** (rising vs. stable vs. declining)

### Step 3: Scoring & Prioritization

**Business Value Score = (Search Volume × Conversion Likelihood × Ticket Value) / Keyword Difficulty**

**Quick Scoring Guide**:
- **Green Flag** (prioritize first):
  - Volume: 500–50,000 monthly
  - Difficulty: Low-Medium (0–40)
  - CPC: $1–$10+
  - Intent: Commercial/transactional

- **Yellow Flag** (phase 2):
  - Volume: 100–500 monthly
  - Difficulty: Low (0–20)
  - CPC: <$1
  - Intent: Informational but qualified

- **Red Flag** (monitor, don't prioritize):
  - Volume: <100 monthly
  - Difficulty: Hard (60+)
  - CPC: <$0.50
  - Intent: Vague/informational

### Step 4: Geographic Targeting Priority

**Start with high-density metro areas**:
1. New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Phoenix (national benchmarks)
2. Secondary markets: Denver, Austin, Portland, Boston, Seattle (tech-savvy, high conversion)
3. Regional expansion: Mid-tier cities (50K–500K population) with less SEO competition
4. Local dominance: Build franchise/scalable model around tier 1–2 cities before nationwide push

### Industries with "Hard" Keywords (Avoid Initially; Build Authority First)

| Food & Beverage | Heavy delivery/franchise competition | Long-tail: "vegan bakery [city]," "custom cake [neighborhood]" |
| Real Estate | Multiple high-authority sites compete | Focus on niche (first-time buyers, foreclosures) + location-specific |
