Key Takeaways

Search Volume Ranges: Tier 1 keywords demonstrate very high search volumes in many cases (e.g., urgent care, car dealerships, daycare each hundreds of thousands of monthly searches). Even some niche local services like tailors or chimney sweeps can have tens of thousands of searches
marketkeep.com
marketkeep.com
. Tier 2 terms generally see much lower volumes (often in the low thousands or hundreds), reflecting more specialized or less universally demanded services.

SEO Difficulty: Many high-volume keywords come with high difficulty scores (often 60–80+ on a 100-point scale). For instance, competitive local intents like “coffee shops near me” carry a KD ~80
gpo.com
, and broad professional terms like “architecture firm” are ~89/100
stanventures.com
. These scores indicate significant competition from well-optimized businesses and directories. Niche and long-tail queries tend to have lower difficulty – often in the 10–40 range – making them easier targets for new or local businesses
gpo.com
.

Regional Variance: The volumes above are for the US/Canada aggregate (or similar English-speaking markets). Many of these services are inherently local, meaning searchers often include “near me” or city names. This local intent can segment the competition geographically. High volume + high KD at a national level (e.g., “urgent care”) may translate into more moderate competition when targeting a specific city or neighborhood, but local SERPs often feature map packs and directory sites, adding to difficulty.

Implications: Businesses in the Tier 1 categories will need robust SEO efforts to rank (targeting local SEO, long-tail variations, and niche services to find lower-competition opportunities). Tier 2 businesses, while having lower search traffic, can often rank more easily by targeting their specific niche keywords and local area. Identifying long-tail keywords with lower competition is a smart strategy – e.g., instead of trying to rank for the head term “coffee shop near me” (KD 80), a small café might optimize for a longer query like “quiet coffee shop for studying [City]” (much lower KD ~11)
gpo.com
. This approach balances search volume and difficulty to achieve better ROI on SEO efforts.
