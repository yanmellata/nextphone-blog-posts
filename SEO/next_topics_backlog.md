# Next Topics Backlog

**Last Updated:** 2025-12-19
**Purpose:** Capture and prioritize new SEO blog topics after the initial 120-post run.
**Scope:** Integration + Workflow, Post-Purchase Ops, Switching/Migration, and Selected Pricing/ROI explainers (optional).

---

## How We’ll Use This

- Treat this as the idea backlog and prioritization workspace.
- Once a topic is approved, it becomes a POST in the production tracker and follows the 4-phase pipeline.

---

## Prioritization Model (Draft)

**Score each topic 0–5 on each dimension (max 25):**
- **Intent Strength** (decision-stage / implementation-focused)
- **ICP Fit** (service businesses, home services, small teams)
- **Differentiation** (can we use NextPhone data or unique angle?)
- **SERP Gap** (weak competitors or missing topic?)
- **Internal Link Depth** (how many existing posts can link into it?)

**Total Score:** __/25
