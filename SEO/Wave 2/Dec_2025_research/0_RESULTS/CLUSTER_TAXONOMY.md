## Notes for Review

### What to Check:

**1. Parent Category Structure:**
- Are all 14 parent categories comprehensive? Missing any major themes?
- Is the hierarchy logical? Should any parents be merged or split?
- Do parent names clearly communicate their purpose?

**2. Child Topic Granularity:**
- Are child topics at the right level of specificity? Too broad or too narrow?
- Should any topics be merged? (e.g., "Google Calendar" + "Outlook Calendar" = "Calendar Integrations"?)
- Should any topics be split? (e.g., "Legal" into "Solo Attorney" + "Law Firm" + "Practice Areas"?)
- Are there obvious gaps in coverage?

**3. Topic Naming:**
- Do topic names make sense? Clear and descriptive?
- Consistent naming conventions across similar topics?
- SEO-friendly keyword alignment?

**4. Post Count Estimates:**
- Do the estimates seem reasonable based on the CSV data?
- Are any categories over/under-represented?
- Does the distribution align with strategic priorities?

**5. Cross-Category Overlap:**
- Are there posts that could fit in multiple categories? (That's OK, but note them)
- Is the primary categorization logical?
- Should we create a "cross-reference" system?

**6. Strategic Alignment:**
- Does this taxonomy support the content strategy goals?
- Are Tier 1 priorities (integrations, IVR, bilingual) properly emphasized?
- Does it enable effective internal linking?

### Potential Refinements:

**Merge Candidates:**
- Consider merging "Professional Services" into "Industry Verticals" (they're all industries)
- Consider merging "Micro-Niches" into "Industry Verticals" (they're just smaller industries)
- "Emergency Response" could be a feature under "Features & Capabilities" instead of standalone

**Split Candidates:**
- "Industry Verticals" could be split into "Field Services" (HVAC, Plumbing, etc.) and "Professional Services" (Legal, Accounting, etc.)
- "Features & Capabilities" could be split by feature type (Communication Features, Analytics Features, etc.)

**Naming Considerations:**
- "Industry Verticals" → "Industry-Specific Solutions"?
- "Integration & Connectivity" → "Integrations & Workflows"?
- "Setup & Implementation" → "Getting Started & Configuration"?

### Next Steps:

1. **Review this taxonomy** with stakeholders
2. **Suggest changes:** merge, split, rename, add, remove topics
3. **Iterate until perfect** - this is a living document
4. **Then assign all 908 posts** to these clusters
5. **Build content calendar** based on cluster priorities
6. **Create internal linking map** using cluster relationships
