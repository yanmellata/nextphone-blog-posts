**Key Insight:** PAA keywords reveal high-intent question-based searches with strong conversion potential. Question-format queries show active decision-making behavior, with 40% transactional/solution-aware intent. Strong focus on implementation ("how to set up"), cost comparison ("how much does it cost"), capabilities ("can AI handle..."), and vertical-specific needs (HVAC, legal, real estate, accounting). Notably absent from guidelines filters - most keywords target service businesses with practical implementation questions.
