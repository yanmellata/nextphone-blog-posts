**Key Insight:** Integration & IVR routing have near-zero competitor coverage with highest conversion intent. Focus shifted to service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, legal, real estate) - removed all HIPAA/healthcare content per user feedback. New high-priority angles: IVR as gateway to AI (especially after-hours), business phone system integrations (Verizon/Twilio), calendar expansion.
