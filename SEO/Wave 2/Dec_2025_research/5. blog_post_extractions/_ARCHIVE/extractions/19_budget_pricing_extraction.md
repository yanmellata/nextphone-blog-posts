**Key Insight:** Budget/pricing keywords reveal three high-intent segments: (1) ROI calculators and cost comparison seekers (high-converting, need interactive tools), (2) industry-specific pricing researchers (HVAC, plumbing, legal, real estate, accounting - ready to buy within vertical context), and (3) pricing transparency hunters (burned by hidden fees, need trust-building content). Strong opportunity for flat-rate positioning against usage-based competitors and employee-vs-AI cost breakdown content.
