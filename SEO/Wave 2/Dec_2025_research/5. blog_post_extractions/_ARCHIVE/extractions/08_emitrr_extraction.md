**Key Insight:** Emitrr has massive content volume (1,211 posts) but is almost entirely healthcare-focused. However, they validate critical non-healthcare topics through 732 posts covering business phone systems (223 posts), SMS/messaging (207 posts), VoIP pricing/comparisons (146 posts), AI automation (29 posts), and service industries (21 posts). Their heavy investment in VoIP alternatives/pricing comparisons (Allworx, RingSquared, Zoom Phone, Clarity Voice) and call routing/transfer/forwarding content validates these as high-value SEO topics. NextPhone can dominate by taking their validated topics and applying them to service businesses (HVAC, legal, real estate, salons) instead of healthcare.
