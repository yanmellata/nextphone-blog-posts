## Excluded Keywords (Per EXTRACTION_GUIDELINES.md)

### Healthcare/Medical (Excluded)
- ❌ #15: answering service dental practice features (dental = healthcare)
- ❌ #24: law firm answering service with transcripts (KEEP - legal ≠ medical, but transcription angle may overlap with compliance)
- ❌ #32: medical practice AI receptionist insurance verification (medical = excluded)

### Analysis: Keyword #24 Edge Case
**Decision:** EXCLUDE #24 (law firm transcripts) - While legal practices are approved industries, the "transcripts for compliance" angle overlaps with regulatory/compliance-heavy content similar to SOC 2/GDPR themes flagged in guidelines. Law firm content is better addressed through general legal industry posts without compliance focus.

### High Competition (Strategic Avoidance)
- ❌ #18: answering service with CRM integration (High volume, Hard difficulty - Ruby, AnswerConnect, Dialpad dominate)
- ❌ #42: AI receptionist 24/7 availability with dashboard (High volume, Hard difficulty - heavily competed)
- ❌ #47: answering service small business owner cheap affordable (High volume, Hard difficulty - price-focused broad search)

### Emerging/Future Content (Low Priority for Blog)
- ⏸️ #25: phone receptionist that can take payments (Emerging capability, unclear product-market fit)
- ⏸️ #33: call answering service with quality assurance (Low volume, better for product feature page)
- ⏸️ #48: phone receptionist outbound calling capability (Emerging use case, low search volume)
