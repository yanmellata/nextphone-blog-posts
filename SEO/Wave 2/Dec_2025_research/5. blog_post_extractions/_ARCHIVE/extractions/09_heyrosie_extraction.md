**Key Insight:** HeyRosie focuses heavily on educational "What is X?" content (8 foundational posts) explaining call center concepts, direct competitor comparisons (3 posts: vs Goodcall, vs Smith.ai, Ruby alternatives), and call handling best practices. They validate demand for glossary-style educational content, comparison switching guides, and tactical phone etiquette/automation guides. Their industry-specific content is limited (only 2 verticals: real estate, plumbing), creating a massive opportunity for NextPhone to dominate vertical-specific implementation guides while matching their strong educational and comparison content strategy.
