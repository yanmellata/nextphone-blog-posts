**Extraction Date:** 2025-12-22
**Total Keywords Analyzed:** 50
**Total Posts Recommended:** 32

**Key Insight:** Seasonal keywords validate major call volume spikes tied to weather events (summer heat waves, winter freezes, storms), holidays (Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas), and industry-specific peak seasons (tax season Feb-April, back-to-school dental, spring real estate). Service businesses experience 200-500%+ call volume increases during these periods, creating acute pain points where AI answering services provide immediate ROI. Post-storm roofing inquiries can surge 500%+ for 2-4 weeks, while HVAC contractors face 200-400% volume increases during summer peaks. These are time-sensitive, high-intent opportunities for content targeting businesses preparing for or actively managing seasonal call overload.
