## Key Themes & Insights

### 1. Billing Pain = Strong Switching Signal
Keywords around "overage charges," "flat pricing," "per-minute," and "hidden fees" indicate users burned by unpredictable billing from Ruby, Smith.ai, Moneypenny. High conversion potential.

### 2. Late-Stage Churn Indicators
Users searching "cancel [competitor]," "cancellation policy," and "[competitor] complaints reddit" are actively leaving. These are ready-to-switch high-intent targets.

### 3. Integration Requirements = Deal Breakers
Clio (legal), Jobber (field service), Follow Up Boss (real estate) integrations are decision factors. These integration posts are high-priority for conversion.

### 4. Industry-Specific = Higher Intent
HVAC, plumbing, legal, real estate, contractors have clear use cases (emergency calls, lead capture, after-hours). Industry-focused content performs better than generic.

### 5. Social Proof Leverage
Reddit-specific keywords (#7, #22) show users trust peer reviews. "What Reddit says" angle adds authenticity to competitor comparisons.

### 6. IVR Upgrade Path
Keyword #18 "auto attendant vs AI receptionist" aligns with guidelines' Tier 1 IVR priority. Positions AI as natural upgrade from basic phone menus.

### 7. Migration Friction Reduction
"How to port number," "migrate from [competitor]," and "free trial no credit card" reduce switching friction. Technical guides + low-risk trials lower barriers.
