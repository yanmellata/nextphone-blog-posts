**Key Insight:** Goodcall heavily invests in industry-specific "How AI is Transforming [X]" content (12 posts across different service sectors), phone system integration guides (Verizon, Google Voice), and appointment scheduling software comparisons. They validate demand for vertical-specific content but keep it surface-level with transformation narratives. NextPhone can dominate by going deeper into implementation playbooks, integration workflows, and tactical ROI metrics for each industry.
