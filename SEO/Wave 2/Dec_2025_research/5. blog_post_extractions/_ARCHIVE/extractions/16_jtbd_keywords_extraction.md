**Key Insight:** JTBD keywords validate that buyers search with outcome-focused language ("never miss a lead," "capture every call," "reduce no-shows") rather than product features. These keywords show strong transactional intent across service industries (HVAC, plumbing, legal, real estate) with specific pain points: after-hours coverage, lead qualification, appointment automation, spam filtering, and professional first impressions. Most keywords are low-competition with high commercial intent, making them ideal for conversion-focused content.
