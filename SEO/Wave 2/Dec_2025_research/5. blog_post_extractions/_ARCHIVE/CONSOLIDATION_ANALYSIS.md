## Deduplication Strategy Recommendation

### Light Deduplication (Expected: 887 → 650-750 posts)

**Approach:**

1. **Exact Duplicates (5-10% reduction):** ~45-90 posts
   - "How to Set Up AI Receptionist" (6 sources) → Keep 1 comprehensive version
   - "HubSpot Integration" (4 sources) → Merge into single deep guide

2. **Near-Duplicates with Different Angles (10-15% reduction):** ~90-135 posts
   - "After-Hours AI Answering" vs "24/7 Coverage" vs "Overnight Call Handling" → Keep 2 versions (general + emergency-focused)
   - "Ruby Alternative" vs "Switching from Ruby" vs "Ruby vs NextPhone" → Keep 2 versions (comparison + migration guide)

3. **Consolidate Sub-Topics (5-10% reduction):** ~45-90 posts
   - Multiple HVAC seasonal posts → Create "HVAC Seasonal Playbook" pillar page + 3-4 supporting posts
   - Various legal intake posts → Consolidate into "Legal Intake Automation Suite" (3-5 posts instead of 8-10)

**Retention Criteria:**
- Keep posts with unique angles (e.g., "Legal Intake" + "Immigration Law Intake" are both valuable)
- Preserve industry-specific variations (HVAC setup ≠ Legal setup)
- Maintain integration-specific guides (HubSpot ≠ Salesforce setup)
- Retain competitor-specific switching content (Ruby migration ≠ Smith.ai migration)

**Result:** ~650-750 unique, high-value posts for master consolidation

---

## Next Steps

Based on this analysis:

### Step 3: Light Deduplication Within Clusters

1. **Legal Cluster (85-95 → 60-70):** Consolidate 8-10 intake posts into 5-6 variants
2. **Setup Cluster (75-85 → 55-65):** Merge overlapping setup guides
3. **Integrations (70-80 → 60-70):** Keep platform-specific guides, merge generic "how to integrate" posts
4. **HVAC (60-70 → 45-55):** Consolidate seasonal posts into pillar + supporting content
5. **Competitor Switching (60-70 → 50-60):** Preserve competitor-specific guides, merge generic alternatives
6. **After-Hours (50-60 → 40-50):** Keep industry-specific + general versions
7. **Other Clusters:** Apply similar 15-20% deduplication

### Step 4: Organize Master Consolidation
