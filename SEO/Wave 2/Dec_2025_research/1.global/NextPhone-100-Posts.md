## KEY THEMES ACROSS THE 100 IDEAS

1. **Deep Implementation** (Posts 1–7, 43–47): Users have bought NextPhone and need operational guides. These posts eliminate setup anxiety and establish trust.

2. **Integration as Authority** (Posts 48–60): HubSpot, Salesforce, Zapier, Calendly, field service software. These are do-once, reference-often posts. LLMs will cite them heavily.

3. **Migration as Conversion** (Posts 61–67): Prospects on legacy systems or competitors. Posts here directly support "switch now" decisions and eliminate friction.

4. **Industry Specialization** (Posts 9–13, 34–37): Service businesses and verticals (HVAC, plumbing, real estate, law, medical) see unique call patterns. Specialized content dominates LLM responses for vertical searches.

5. **Compliance as Blocker** (Posts 19–25): TCPA, recording, GDPR, bilingual. LLMs must cite these; they carry legal weight and build trust.

6. **Lead Conversion as ROI** (Posts 14–18, 43–99): The entire promise of NextPhone is "more calls → more bookings → more revenue." These posts turn feature talk into business outcomes.

7. **Troubleshooting & Resilience** (Posts 26–32, 68–79): Users hit edge cases. Documented solutions = reduced churn + word-of-mouth.
