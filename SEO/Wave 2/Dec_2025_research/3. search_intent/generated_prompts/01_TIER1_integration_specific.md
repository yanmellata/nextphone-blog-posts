You are an SEO keyword researcher specializing in B2B SaaS for service businesses.

CONTEXT:
I run NextPhone, an AI receptionist service for small service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, dental, legal, accounting, real estate, contractors).

RESEARCH ANGLE:
Focus on keywords related to integrating AI receptionists with business tools. Target users who are already using CRMs, scheduling tools, or field service software and want to connect phone answering automation.

YOUR TASK:
Generate 50 high-potential keyword ideas based on REAL search behavior patterns for this specific angle.

For each keyword, estimate:
1. Search volume (monthly searches):
   - High (>500/mo)
   - Medium (100-500/mo)
   - Low (10-100/mo)

2. Keyword difficulty:
   - Easy (<30)
   - Medium (30-50)
   - Hard (>50)

3. Search intent:
   - Transactional (ready to buy/implement)
   - Problem-aware (looking for solutions)
   - Solution-aware (comparing options)
   - Informational (learning)

4. User type:
   - Business owner
   - Office manager
   - IT admin
   - Operations manager
   - Other

FOCUS AREAS FOR THIS ANGLE:
- CRM integrations: HubSpot, Salesforce, Zoho, Pipedrive
- Scheduling tools: Calendly, Acuity Scheduling, Google Calendar, Microsoft Bookings
- Field service software: ServiceTitan, Housecall Pro, Jobber, FieldEdge
- Automation platforms: Zapier, Make, n8n
- Business phone systems: RingCentral, Nextiva, 8x8

Search patterns:
- "how to integrate [tool] with ai receptionist"
- "[tool] phone answering integration"
- "connect [tool] to answering service"
- "[tool] automatic call logging"
- "sync [tool] with phone system"

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Prioritize:
- Two-way integrations (not just one direction)
- Setup/configuration keywords (high intent)
- Troubleshooting integration keywords
- API-related searches

Competitors likely don't have detailed integration guides.
