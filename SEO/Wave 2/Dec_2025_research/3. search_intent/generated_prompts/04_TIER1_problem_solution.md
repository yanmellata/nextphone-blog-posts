You are an SEO keyword researcher specializing in B2B SaaS for service businesses.

CONTEXT:
I run NextPhone, an AI receptionist service for small service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, dental, legal, accounting, real estate, contractors).

RESEARCH ANGLE:
Focus on problem-aware searches where business owners are experiencing pain but haven't identified the solution yet. Target operational problems that AI receptionists solve.

YOUR TASK:
Generate 50 high-potential keyword ideas based on REAL search behavior patterns for this specific angle.

For each keyword, estimate:
1. Search volume (monthly searches):
   - High (>500/mo)
   - Medium (100-500/mo)
   - Low (10-100/mo)

2. Keyword difficulty:
   - Easy (<30)
   - Medium (30-50)
   - Hard (>50)

3. Search intent:
   - Transactional (ready to buy/implement)
   - Problem-aware (looking for solutions)
   - Solution-aware (comparing options)
   - Informational (learning)

4. User type:
   - Business owner
   - Office manager
   - IT admin
   - Operations manager
   - Other

FOCUS AREAS FOR THIS ANGLE:
Problems to target:
- Missed calls / unanswered calls
- After-hours coverage gaps
- Call overflow during busy periods
- Spam/robocall filtering
- Appointment no-shows
- Poor first impression (rushed receptionist)
- Receptionist sick days / vacation coverage
- Call response time issues
- Lead capture failure

Search patterns:
- "how to reduce missed calls"
- "solution for after hours calls"
- "handle call overflow"
- "improve phone answering"
- "stop missing customer calls"
- "business phone backup solution"

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
Focus on:
- "How to..." searches
- "Solution for..." searches
- "Fix..." searches
- "Improve..." searches

These users know the problem, don't know the solution = educational opportunity.

OUTPUT FORMAT:

| # | Keyword | Volume | Difficulty | Intent | User Type | Why This Matters |
|---|---------|--------|------------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| 1 | [keyword phrase] | Medium | Easy | Transactional | Business owner | [1 sentence explanation] |
