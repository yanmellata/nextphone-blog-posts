You are an SEO keyword researcher specializing in B2B SaaS for service businesses.

CONTEXT:
I run NextPhone, an AI receptionist service for small service businesses (HVAC, plumbing, dental, legal, accounting, real estate, contractors).

RESEARCH ANGLE:
Focus on HVAC contractor-specific phone answering needs. Target HVAC business owners dealing with emergency calls, seasonal surge, after-hours service, and appointment scheduling.

YOUR TASK:
Generate 50 high-potential keyword ideas based on REAL search behavior patterns for this specific angle.

For each keyword, estimate:
1. Search volume (monthly searches):
   - High (>500/mo)
   - Medium (100-500/mo)
   - Low (10-100/mo)

2. Keyword difficulty:
   - Easy (<30)
   - Medium (30-50)
   - Hard (>50)

3. Search intent:
   - Transactional (ready to buy/implement)
   - Problem-aware (looking for solutions)
   - Solution-aware (comparing options)
   - Informational (learning)

4. User type:
   - Business owner
   - Office manager
   - IT admin
   - Operations manager
   - Other

FOCUS AREAS FOR THIS ANGLE:
- Emergency call handling (burst pipes, no heat, AC breakdown)
- Seasonal surge management (summer cooling, winter heating)
- After-hours emergency routing
- Appointment scheduling for maintenance
- Service area screening
- Technician dispatch coordination
- Callback management during busy season

Search patterns:
- "hvac emergency call answering"
- "after hours hvac answering service"
- "hvac appointment scheduling software"
- "best answering service for hvac"
- "hvac call overflow management"
- "air conditioning emergency calls"

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:
HVAC-specific pain points:
- Summer/winter seasonal spikes (10x call volume)
- Emergency calls need immediate routing (not voicemail)
- Technician in field can't answer phone
- Service area qualification (zip code screening)

Use HVAC industry terminology.
