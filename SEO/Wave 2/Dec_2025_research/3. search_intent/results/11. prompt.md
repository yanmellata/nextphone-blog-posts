# NextPhone SEO Keyword Research – Seasonal & Event-Based

## Research Summary

### Key Findings from Research

**HVAC seasonality**  
- Summer peak: June–August sees 200–400% volume increase, and first major heat waves trigger sharp call spikes [web:3][web:6].  
- October can also be a peak HVAC season period in some markets [web:6].  
- Winter peaks (Dec–Feb) driven by heating emergencies raise call volume significantly above baseline [web:20].

**Roofing storm season**  
- Post‑storm surges can generate 500%+ increases in roofing inquiries for 2–4 weeks, especially after hail and major wind events [web:40][web:43].  
- Insurance claim deadlines often create a secondary spike 2–3 weeks after the initial storm [web:40].

**Accounting / tax season**  
- Tax season for accountants and CPAs runs heavily from early February through the April 15 deadline [web:11][web:19].  
- Firms report “whirlwind” demand and capacity constraints during this period, especially on phones [web:11].

**Plumbing seasonality**  
- Winter freeze events drive a spike in calls about frozen or burst pipes and emergency plumbing work [web:20][web:23].  
- Spring thaw periods also increase call volume for follow‑up issues and damage repairs [web:23].

**Dental practice seasonality**  
- Dental offices experience scheduling and staffing challenges around major holidays and closures [web:21][web:24].  
- Back‑to‑school campaigns (July–September) are a known high‑demand period for pediatric and family dentistry [web:39][web:45].

**Holiday call volume**  
- Contact centers and service businesses often see a ~40%+ increase in call volume around Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday [web:2][web:8].  
- Post‑holiday periods (returns, follow‑ups) also drive elevated call volume [web:5][web:51].

**Real estate seasonality**  
- Real estate teams see peak call and inquiry volume during primary selling seasons, with substantial after‑hours and weekend activity [web:41][web:44].  
- Dedicated answering or call center services are commonly recommended for real estate to avoid missed leads [web:44][web:47].

**B2B SaaS keyword strategy**  
- Seasonal SEO is most effective when mapped to known demand spikes and refreshed annually with updated dates and angles [web:1][web:4][web:7].  
- For B2B SaaS, long‑tail, high‑intent keywords (3–6 words) targeting decision‑makers and specific use cases tend to perform best [web:10][web:22][web:28].

### Search Intent & User Types
